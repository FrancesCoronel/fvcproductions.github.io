# EditorConfig is an config file that helps to
# enforce coding styles across different editors
#
# For the most part, you'll need to download a plugin
# to get your IDE to recognize this file. There are,
# however, editors that support EditorConfig natively
# (e.g., Coda, BBEdit, IntelliJIDEA, etc.)
