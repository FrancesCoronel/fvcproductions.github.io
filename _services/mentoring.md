## Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools.

So far, Iâ€™ve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like [Fullstack Academy](http://fullstackacademy.com), [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com), and [MakerSquare](http://makersquare.com).

Iâ€™ve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field.

> As of **March 2017**, Iâ€™ve dedicated **over 35 hours** of my free time mentoring awesome people.

Feedback from my mentoring sessions can be found in the [feedback section](http://fvcproductions.com/feedback) of my website.

### If youâ€™re interested in being mentored, please feel free to [contact me](http://fvcproductions.com/contact) through my website. ðŸ“¨

A list of **all** of my mentoring sessions can be found in the Airtable below.
