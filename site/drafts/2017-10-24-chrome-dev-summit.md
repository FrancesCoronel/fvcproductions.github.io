### Why I Love the Web

On the way to work, in our homes, offices and fields, in times of peace,
conflict and emergencies, radio remains a crucial source of information and
knowledge, spanning generations and cultures, inspiring us with the wealth of
humanity's diversity, and connecting us with the world.

Radio is still the most dynamic, reactive and engaging medium there is, adapting
to 21st century changes and offering new ways to interact and participate.
