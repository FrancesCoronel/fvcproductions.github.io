Although I've been using GitHub for nearly 5 years now, I've only just recently had the chance take the role of a maintainer of active F/OSS.

Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.

According to the Linux Foundation, there are actually 4 recognized stages of corporate open source participation.

The 4 stages being Consumption, Participation, Influencing, and Initiation.

But with GitHub, I've broken these stages down even further into 10 different ones.

Consumption

celebrity (joins GitHub and immediately gets a crap ton of followers because they're Linux-level famous but don't actually have much activity on GitHub)
newbie (viewing repos)
stargazer (actively starring repos)
Participation

issue ally (raises issue or comments on issues)
contributing pro (contributing to active projects)
Influencing

maintainer virtuoso (in charge of reviewing PRs for an active project)
Initiation

lover (constantly working on anything and everything open-source)
leader (someone who is widely recognized for their open source work on GitHub - think Sindre Sorhus)
GitHubber

GitHubber (decides they love GitHub so much, they join GitHub full-time)
I've gotten to the point where I'm comfortable raising issues and contributing fixes but
