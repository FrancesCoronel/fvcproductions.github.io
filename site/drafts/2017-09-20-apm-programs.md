This post will attempt to cover full-time roles available to recent grads for the position of an "Associate Product Manager".

I will not be looking at internships or the APMM (Associate Product Marketing Manager) positions so if you're interested in those instead, Google is your friend.

## Qualifiers

> Companies have different wants and needs for their APMs. Some, like Amazon, prefer those with a more business background while others like Google will be less likely to hire an APM who doesn't have a strong technical background.

Generally speaking, though, APMs generally want to have the following:

* A Bachelor's degree or higher in engineering or business
* Internships in the tech sector
* Strong writing, speaking and leadership skills
* Sharp critical thinking skills with a heavy reliability on data to drive decision making
* The ability to code and/or pass whiteboard interviews
