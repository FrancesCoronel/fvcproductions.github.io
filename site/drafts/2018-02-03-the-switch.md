## Why

![Google Pixel Order](https://i.imgur.com/y8W5UL5.png)

So I recently decided that I was sick of Apple constantly raising the cost of their products and that I was sick of not being able to take advantage of a more flexible ecosystem.

The base price of the recent iPhone X is $1000. In our existing environment where income inequality is at an all-time high, this base price speaks volume as to who exactly Apple's target consumers are - a very small extremely rich portion of the overall population.

And frankly, yes - this could definitely work fine for Apple but I don't believe it to be a sustainable model. I used to think of Apple as this sort of eccentric company catering to those who saw themselves as different and were proud of that. I remember getting my first MacBook Pro in 2009 and how a whole new creative world opened up for me in how I interacted with their ecosystem and the many products that only their ecosystem was able to support.

But alas, this is no longer the case. When I think of Apple now, I see this arrogant, corporate heavy, cater to the rich only type company. I no longer see leading products coming out of this company and while I have been an Apple fan-girl for nearly 10 years, I've decided it's time to move the fuck on.

While another company has been able to provide what I want for a phone, there hasn't been a company yet that has been able to provide what I want from a laptop (Apple included).

Ideally, Google will come out with a better PixelBook that supports more of the programs I've grown to know and love that unfortunately only work on macOS or Windows (I don't want to work with Windows) as of right now.

The main reason being that Google's desktop operating system is ChromeOS and ChromeOS is basically a wrapper for a bunch of web based apps. Now, this is actually one of the aspects I think makes ChromeOS great.

Because when you look at most of the tools we use on a daily basis (unless you're a hardcore video editor but even that could change soon), we are using our browser to access them. Google realized this early on and centers their entire OS around this idea. Discord, 1Password, Slack, Grammarly, calendar, email, notes, presentation software, Spotify, etc. - a lot of apps I use daily are are all capable of running on the web without sacrificing feature access. Web is the future of OS.

However, a lot of great dev apps that I depend on have also not adopted this cross-platform/web model that allows the developers to create the app once and then have it work on both the web and across all major OS (all the great text editors, Sketch, diff/merge tools, productivity tools like Alfred, GUI clients for GitHub).

So anywho, with that little rant as context, I decided in November of last year to make that first switch and go from iOS to Android.

AND let me tell you - the results have been GREAT.

So just switch, geez.

## How

The main thing though that folks want to know when making the switch is which apps will replace those built-in ones they love so much from iOS.

All these Google based apps are smarter than the Apple based ones since they directly feed off all the information you provide Google through search.

So let's go through these one-by-one...

> Pro Tip: Use [Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) to easily install the desktop apps.

### Books

> iBooks üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Play Books

‚ÑπÔ∏è **FYI** If you need help finding out where your ePub/PDF files are from iBooks, this Stack Overflow answer for [Where are my iBooks stored in macOS Sierra?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259836/where-are-my-ibooks-stored-in-macos-sierra) will become quite handy.

### Browser

> Safari üëâüèΩÔ∏è Chrome

Ok so the only reason I ever use Safari is for PIP or Picture-in-Picture.

Unfortunately, the current solutions for Chrome [are quite dismal](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254701/how-to-use-picture-in-picture-in-chrome).

My sister uses Safari because she thinks the UI is cleaner which doesn't make sense to me but it's okay Rosi - you do you. üòÇ

### Calendar

> Apple Calendar üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Calendar

Google Calendar is great of course and completely cross-platform with integrations in Google Inbox & Google Keep but it doesn't work with other email providers like Outlook.

Unfortunately, I use Outlook for work so for the time being, I use Fantastical whenever I'm on my Mac.

Whenever I'm on the go, I ignore work related stuff and just use Google Calendar which has everything else I need (lol).

![Integration - Example 1](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l7OvX1ci4H4/VmURUPETz6I/AAAAAAAAB1A/gXFApvl13C4/s1600/calendar3.png)

### Email

> Mail üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Inbox

![Integration - Example 2](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/4874/screenshots/1832700/big.gif)

### File Transfer

> File Transfer üëâüèΩ Portal by Pushbullet

### Fitness

> Health üëâüèΩÔ∏è Export Health Data üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Fit

### Money

> Wallet üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Pay

### Music

> iTunes üëâüèΩÔ∏è Spotify or Google Play Music

### Navigation

> Apple Maps üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Maps

Okay - IMO - if you were actually ever using Apple Maps, I have nothing to say to you except wow, that makes no sense at all. My sister uses Apple Maps still for some arbitrary reason and I mock her for it all the time. Rosi, if you're reading this, I don't feel a shred of empathy. üòÇ

### News

> Apple News üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Play Newsstand

Initially, I was actually pretty fine with using Google Play Newsstand which is completely cross platform unlike Apple News.

Apple News is solely supported on iOS.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://www.apple.com/news/">News</a></h4><p>News helps you stay on top of all the top stories. And the For You section makes sure you're seeing the stories you care about most.</p></blockquote>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Google Play Newsstand is supported by [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-newsstand/id459182288?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.magazines) & [Web](https://newsstand.google.com/).

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.magazines">Google Play Newsstand - Apps on Google Play</a></h4><p>Google Play Newsstand is a personalized news reader that provides a single destination for browsing the topics, news sources, and magazines you care about.Enjoy access to thousands of free and premium news sources, leading magazines, and specialized publications.</p></blockquote>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Regardless, when are more companies going to realize that the web is the future of mobile & OS anyways?

### Notes

> Notes üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Keep

As I mentioned before, Google Keep [integrates really well](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/turn-google-best-app-ever/) with Google Inbox & Google Calendar.

HOWEVER. For me, personally, it just doesn't have a UI right now that supports long form notes which is what I mostly used Notes for.

Quick jots for me were always created as reminders or soon turned into longer notes.

There are a lot of note taking options honestly with notable ones being Evernote, Quip & Notion.

I used to love using Quip but I've since switched to just using Notion for any note-taking since it integrates well with Slack and has a better UX.

For now, Notion is just supported on web and iOS but I expect that to change soon.

### Photos

> Apple Photos üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Photos

Unlimited storage and a 10x better UI than Apple Photos? I was already using Google to store photos **way before** the switch.

### Reminders

> Reminders üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Keep

Hmmm. This is where things got a little hairy. The reason I liked using Reminders so much is because it was very simplistic and integrated with my favorite calendar - Fantastical.

### SMS

> iMessage üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Allo (?)

Things are kinda fishy here. Google has way too many apps for messaging (Google Hangouts, Allo & Android Messages) and it rightfully confuses consumers who interact with them.

Granted, you won't get Animoji but Allo is more cross-platform than Apple Messages by working on both Android & iOS **as well** as the web.

Unfortunately, it's been hard to convince everyone I text to use Allo with me so I've had to stick with Google Messages.

### Video

> FaceTime üëâüèΩÔ∏è Google Duo

As I said before, Google's communication offerings can definitely confuse consumers and they really need to still work on centralizing everything into one platform.

For professional stuff, I prefer to use [Daily.co](https://daily.co) but of course for personal calls, you can't go wrong with Google Duo which is supported by both Android & iOS.

[![Google Duo](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-duo1.png?w=730&crop=1)](https://duo.google.com/)

In [January of this year](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-web-support-group-calls-better-audio-quality-829305/), the Duo team teased that Duo would be coming to the web soon but who the hell really knows?

But yes, ideally, Duo becomes even more cross-platform because then it could compete with FaceTime even better.
