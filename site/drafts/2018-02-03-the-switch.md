So I recently decided that I was sick of Apple constantly raising the cost of their products and that I was sick of not being able to take advantage of a more flexible ecosystem.

The base price of the recent iPhone X is $1000. In our existing environment where income inequality is at an all-time high, this base price speaks volume as to who exactly Apple's target consumers are - a very small extremely rich portion of the overall population.

And frankly, yes - this could definitely work fine for Apple but I don't believe it to be a sustainable model. I used to think of Apple as this sort of eccentric company catering to those who saw themselves as different and were proud of that. I remember getting my first MacBook Pro in 2009 and how a whole new creative world opened up for me in how I interacted with their ecosystem and the many products that only their ecosystem was able to support.

But alas, this is no longer the case. When I think of Apple now, I see this arrogant, corporate heavy, cater to the rich only type company. I no longer see leading products coming out of this company and while I have been an Apple fan-girl for nearly 10 years, it's time to move the fuck on.

While another company has been able to provide what I want for a phone, there hasn't been a company yet that has been able to provide what I want from a laptop (Apple included).

Ideally, Google will come out with a better PixelBook that supports more of the programs I've grown to know and love that unfortunately only work on macOS or Windows (I don't want to work with Windows) as of right now.

The main reason being that Google's desktop operating system is ChromeOS and ChromeOS is basically a wrapper for a bunch of web based apps. Now, this is actually one of the aspects I think makes ChromeOS great. Because when you look at most of the tools we use on a daily basis (unless you're a hardcore video editor but even that could change soon), we are using our browser to access them. Google realized this early on and centers their entire OS around this idea. Discord, 1Password, Slack, Grammarly, calendar, email, notes, presentation software, Spotify, etc. - a lot of apps I use daily are are all capable of running on the web without sacrificing feature access.

However, a lot of great dev apps that I depend on have also not adopted this cross-platform/web model that allows the developers to create the app once and then have it work on both the web and across all major OS (all the great text editors, Sketch, diff/merge tools, productivity tools like Alfred, GUI clients for GitHub).

So anywho, with that little rant as context, I decided in November of last year to make that first switch and go from iOS to Android.

AND let me tell you - the results have been GREAT.
