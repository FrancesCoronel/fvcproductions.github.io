I had known of Startup Grind for some time now but I'm not one for attending conferences unless I can go for free so with a steep price (it's about 700 bucks at the door, I think?), the only way I was ever going to attend is through a scholarship of some sort.

Thankfully, I've been part of this amazing organization - [Women Who Code](//www.womenwhocode.com) - for about 3 years now and I knew they gave away free tickets for big events like this.

I applied for a free ticket and I got it!

### Day 1 - February 13

### Day 2 - February 14

I was initially somewhat excited for the next talk on **"Building New Worlds: Lesson From Gaming and Enterpise Software"** because someone from Slack was speaking.

I personally think that if Silicon Valley were a high school (so cliquey!), Slack would be the captain of the football team or some shit like that - either way everyone knows Slack is one of the "cool kids".

And while the origin story of how Slack actually came about was pretty cool, I didn't find the rest of the talk all that compelling.

I also didn't appreciate a comment the interviewer made about hiring a bunch of Filipinos to do some manual work because it came across as crude.

The next talk was on **"Why eSports is the Next Billion-Dollar Industry"**. Frankly, I'm not interested in gaming (I've always looked at it as a waste of time) so it was kind of a let down for me but my friend, Angela, seemed to enjoy it a lot.

I will say that Amit was one of the best interviewers of the day. I could tell he had prepared and he seemed genuinely engaged the whole time.

The last talk I listened to was "Building and Scaling High Performance Teams".

The key reminder I got from this talk is that it's critical to be able to craft a compelling story of the problem you solve as a startup. Because if you can't tell that story, you're going to be less likely to be able to convince anyone to invest time, money or really anything on your idea.

Since that was the last major talk of the day, I decided I was done and started to head home.

My partner got me a bouquet from Edible Arrangements for Valentine's Day so I picked it up afterward and it served as a pretty great ending to a long day.

### Takeaways

I noticed throughout the conference that speakers kept idolizing Elon Musk in some shape or form. He was just put on this sort of untouchable pedestal the whole time. He was also compared to Steve Jobs a lot.

This mentality of Elon Musk being this sort of amazing unicorn and being heralded as this generation's Steve Jobs bothered me quite a bit because both Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are not the kind of people I believe should be idolized this way.

It's already well known that Steve Jobs was a world class asshole and would treat people under him badly for very small mistakes. Despite this and all his other personality and social shortcomings, Steve Jobs was still seen as a revolutionary within the tech industry.

Elon Musk himself told his own wife that he was the "alpha" in their relationship at their WEDDING. How fucked up is that? Is that really the kind of man you want to be in a relationship with? Someone who considers themselves superior and is willing to overwork his (mostly male) employees to the bone or to the point where they literally go ape shit?

#### Being an asshole should not be an aspiration for anyone.

And having models like these two privileged white men in Silicon Valley is probably part of the reason we end up with CEOs like Travis Kalanick who was willing to do anything to get ahead of the competition.

In the US, unfortunately, there is very little financial incentive in creating innovative technological solutions that solve REAL social problems (income inequality, sexual abuse, mental health, gun control, climate change, scalable housing and transportation infrastructure, etc).

So, in many ways, it makes sense that we're stuck in this environment where companies are spending a shit ton of money on what I feel are less relevant issues like autonomous cars and space travel.

Automobile companies in the Bay Area stifled the growth of widespread public transportation for decades and now so many are stuck with some of the shittiest traffic in the US. Having AVs instead doesn't negate the fact that we have more and more people being born every day who will need to get from one place to the other cheap and fast.

If we really think about how the ideal future looks like, the idea of cars being the most desirable mode of travel doesn't even make sense! At some point, I think folks will realize that investing more money into infrastructure for public transportation which benefits the masses instead of the few makes a HELLA lot more sense.

In regards to SpaceX, I'll leave it to this Quora answer to sum up how I feel.

Adams's answer: I don't know about flaws, exactly, but all his talk about putting a large colony on Mars is pure snake oil to excite the gullible enthusiast for space exploration.

If we want to serve the greater good, we need to first start changing our standards to who represents "greatness". Greatness to me is not what Elon Musk and Steve Jobs embody. Greatness to me, instead, is being able to admit you're not perfect and being able to work on an EQUAL level with others towards a meaningful cause. Greatness is not just about being inspiring, it's also about being sustainable in your practices and moral behavior.

And once we are able to raise our standards, we can then start putting power into the next generation of diverse driven individuals who want to solve the REAL problems.

I'm talking about the real problems that are just as difficult as getting humans on Mars but can actually impact a lot of people more positively.

Ideally, the next generation to be in power recognizes these shortcomings within the all too powerful tech industry. I'm reminded of the young woman - Emma Gonzalez - who responded to the most recent of school shootings that happened right on Valentine's Day.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxD3o-9H1lY">Florida student to NRA and Trump: 'We call BS'</a></h4><p>Emma Gonzalez, a student at the Parkland, Florida high school where 17 people were left dead after a mass shooting, calls out President Trump and the NRA by name at an anti-gun rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p></blockquote>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/emma-gonzalez-florida-shooting.html">What Students Said About Guns After 14 of Their Classmates Were Killed</a></h4><p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - They shouted into a microphone until their voices became hoarse. They waved handmade signs. They chanted. And sometimes, in the middle of it all, they choked up. At the federal courthouse here on Saturday, students - including many of the very people who had to endure the trauma of a shooting on campus - continued to speak out about guns.</p></blockquote>

She spoke of the ineffectiveness of the current system in regards to gun control. And she spoke with such passion and vigor that it made me happy to know that there are teenagers still out there who can speak up like that.

We need the next generation to be comfortable with taking action themselves to solve these social issues at hand that affect the MAJORITY of us - the 99%. Because if we don't, I fear we might just have to end up living on fucking Mars.
