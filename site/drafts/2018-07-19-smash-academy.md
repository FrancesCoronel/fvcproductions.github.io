I presented high-schoolers from Level Playing Field Institute, an education empowerment social arm of the Kapor Center of Social Impact run by Bay Area technology legends Freda & Mitch Kapor.

Level Playing Field Institute is an Oakland-based non-profit that is committed to eliminating the barriers faced by underrepresented people of color in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and fostering their untapped talent for the advancement of our nation. Their signature program, the Summer Math and Science Honors (SMASH) Academy, is a rigorous STEM acceleration college preparatory program for underrepresented high school students of color to excel in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

I have presented and given talks in the past, but I was very nervous to give a talk to 85 high-school scholars from LPFI's Stanford SMASH Academy cohort, given my first time presenting to high-schoolers. It takes a lot of self-reflection and deep-thought when you speak to someone in the next-generation. The nervousness was more to not disappoint the scholars, ensure the content was impactful, accountable and actionable. Considering my topic was "Technology, Diversity & Inclusion and Navigating STEM as a person of color", I wanted to ensure I touched on the important focal points, challenges I personally faced while navigating my journey in the STEM field, and how to succeed while facing the prevalent rhetoric/marginalization/diversity issues and prevent it from derailing your own confidence, and charting your path to success.

By the end of my talk, and a panel discussion, I was astounded, amazed and really excited by the sheer potential I saw in front of me.

I would summarize my personal learning through my transformative experience of meeting those amazing kids in 5 points:

---

SMASH Academy is a part of the Level Playing Field Institute (LPFI), an education empowerment social arm of the Kapor Center of Social Impact. SMASH is a free of cost, STEM-intensive college preparatory program for underrepresented high school students of color. This state of the art program is run in partnership with several universities, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, and Stanford University.

✔︎ I presented my career path, moments of resilience and some key advice as one of three speakers for the SMASH Speaker Series at Stanford University on July 19th, 2018 from 7 pm to 9 pm.
