All Accenture employees who sign up for access to Pluralsight & Code School also get access to a team leaderboard. Right now, I am ranked #29 across all the employees for Code School but would like to be ranked in the top 10 within 6 months.

What are you most proud of?

The fact I was able to do this in less than 5 months after joining. I became #10 in September out of over 10,000 Accenture employees who use Code School. Read less

What will you take away from this experience?

It won't stop here. I'm going to keep trying to advance myself through Code School courses since I find them so enjoyable.

What actions will you take to improve or grow further?

Code School is and will always be an amazing resource for me to stay on top of the new languages and frameworks out there. I'm very grateful to have access through Accenture. Read less
