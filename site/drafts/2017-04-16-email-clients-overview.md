I've always been somewhat obsessed with keeping up with the latest and greatest
productivity tools, so naturally I've looked into some email clients.

The solution I ended up going with is **Inbox** and intentionally abandoning my iCloud email.

The only downside to Inbox is that it's Google accounts only so I can't utilize its power with any other email providers like Outlook or iCloud.

## Mail + MailButler

* extended features don't extend to mobile offering
* also, I have an Android now

## Polymail

* star functionality missing?

## Canary

* UI not intuitive enough

## Spark

* not enough features

## Airmail

* too many lists created

## Inbox

* love but does not accept multiple clients

## Nylas Mail

* love but so damn slow!!
* cannot setup Exchange account

## Postbox

* difficult to setup
* seeing flagged emails is not as easy to do
