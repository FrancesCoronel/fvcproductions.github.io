## About

> The following description is taken from the company's website.

In our business conversations, we want to maximize our impact — and that means projecting executive presence. Through a series of coaching exercises, we guide each participant to practice the four key behaviors necessary for executive presence.

Day 1: This is a video feedback program, so we start with an assessment of your strengths and challenges. Then we help you apply the four behaviors to your individual style of speaking, to ensure you retain your own personality. We use theatre exercises to help you discover what you need to own your space and get your listeners involved. By the end of Day 1, your films will show the difference these behaviors make. You will see a more powerful and engaged communicator.

Day 2: The second day is dedicated to applying the principles you learned to communicate your specific content. When your business content is sticky, and listener focused, you can accelerate the results you want. One of the most successful ways to make communication more memorable is by using storytelling principles. Borrowing from the world of cinema, we teach you how to structure an oral story to create vivid, memorable scenes. The final filming demonstrates the difference a well coached, highly trained communicator can achieve: Riveting content with powerful delivery.

2-Day Impact Leadership Communication is \$14,000 for up to 10 individuals; plus facilitator travel expenses.

This program is tailored to meet each client's unique needs.
