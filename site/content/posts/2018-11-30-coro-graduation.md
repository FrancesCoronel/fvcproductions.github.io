## Professional Narrative

Hello, I'm Frances and I'm a unicorn that engineers solutions on behalf of another unicorn.

Let me break that down.

The term "unicorn" was coined in the tech industry because researchers found that the statistical likelihood of a tech startup becoming valued at 1 billion dollars or more is about 1%.

And it just so happens that the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that only 1% of women in tech identify as Latina.

So now you can see how one can be a unicorn or a Latina software engineer such as myself and can work for another unicorn like the enterprise startup Slack - which is worth 7 billion.

However, I have no desire for the situation to remain this way as my existence in tech shouldn't have to be this rare and magical event.

Instead, I'd like to band together with other unicorns so that we can lead, influence and inspire the next generation of minority women to not just break into but also prosper.

Together, I believe we can transform ourselves from these mythical creatures to the more common but magnificent stallions.
