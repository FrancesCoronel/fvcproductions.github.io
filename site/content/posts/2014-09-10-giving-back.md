**Yesterday**, I successfully packaged a bag of Air Heads, an appreciative letter, and the complete and unabridged works of Edgar Allen Poe in support of [Peter Sunde](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Sunde/126485467393990) - hope he enjoys it!

My mom even sent a letter to [Gottfrid](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gottfrid-Svartholm/103131853059969)...

**Later today**, my mum provided the receipt that she got from the Postal Service. It had a smiley face in red with a little message right above the $35.64 price that was necessary for the parcel to arrive in Sweden. The message complained about something along the lines "This sacrifice is well worth it.". I later complained to her about her subtle complaint. It ended as a truce.

Overall, it was definitely a decent day. :grin:
