## Name

[Fullstack Academy - Summer of Code](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/summer-of-code "Fullstack Academy")

Fullstack Academy is an immersive, full-time, 3-month web development course with an 8% acceptance rate focusing on JavaScript and the MEAN stack in New York City that strives to prepare students for top development jobs at tech firms and startups.

The Summer of Code program within Fullstack Academy gives college students, specifically, the opportunity to study full-stack JS web development while on summer break.

My testimonial of the program was featured on their website through the Summer of Code page (December 2015).

- Solidified knowledge of core programming concepts (e.g OOP, async, regex, recursion)
- Learned the fundamentals of full-stack JS web development using the MEAN stack

- Encouraged to become more than just a great coder through the CTO program
