### Anndrea Moore

- spreadsheet for tracking job applications
- don't just apply online, use referrals
- network
- maybe 90% of time you won't get feedback but always keep asking because when you do get feedback, it can very valuable
- when it comes to prepping for interviews, reach out to your network and use resources like Quora, Glassdoor, Blind, etc.

### April Speight

- develop an online presence
- accepting job with Microsoft
- use folders in your email to keep track of job applications
- save job descriptions since they get taken down
- when it comes to prepping for interviews, the "tell me about yourself" can seem terrifying but would recommend just telling a story about how your personal experience directly relates to the role you're applying for

### Cindy Alvarez

- hiring managers usually don't know how to write job descriptions
- feedback usually isn't given because companies are terrified of liability issues
- candidates will argue back
- in all honesty, if interviewer is asking the "tell me about yourself" question, it is likely to

### Elizabeth Bautista

- create your own job
- if a job wants 5 years of experience, consider that open source work and hackathons you've done, a career development program you've completed - those all tie in and can be considered experience as well
- if candidate gets rejected and the emails are confrontational, they are usually deferred back to the recruiter
- when it comes to prepping for interviews, make sure to prepare with questions that are relevant since you've ideally done your research on the company when it comes to culture, demographics, etc.

> It was nice to see Ei-Nyung who also works at Slack talking about her career path.

## Social Impact: The Road Less Traveled...

> I helped Serena debug her technical issues before she started her talk.

Serena works at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She first gave the audience different stats on Latino households...

- 14% without a bank account
- households increased by 167,000
- 31.5% have no mainstream credit
- population grew to 56.5 million or 17% of the total US population
- since 2012, they account for 59% of new home ownership in the country

So seeing these issues down the horizon, she decided to look into creating a website that was created in Spanish and focuses on bank accounts, credit and home buying.

It didn't work out but then her team decided to focus on the portion that got the most traffic and expanded on that which were the single Q&A pages.

> Recap

- inserts on high traffic pages
- improve SEO
