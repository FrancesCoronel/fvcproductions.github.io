## About

Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of me while speaking, but given that it was the first time I spoke in front of a large group of people and I was terribly nervous in the beginning, it's probably for the best.

I will say though that I think I did pretty well with the hiccups. I worked really hard in making a compelling video that I could use as an example. I also had to make sure I was able to get an adapater at the last minute since I had wrongly assumed there would be one. I learned right there that I should always be prepared when presenting.

Apparently my example video even made someone from the OP Smile student team tear up which definitely led me to have mixed feelings because on one hand - wow, what a response and on the other, oh no - don't cry!

### iMovie 101

I presented the basics of video editing using iMovie to Operation Smile mission trainees.
