## Why

I helped setup React training with Michael Jackson, the creator of React Router, at our SF 22 office.

## What

The point of WOTW is to increase visibility of, and to some extent socialize the possibility of, big wins coming from regular, solid, individual efforts on non-herculean scope. Unlike large, heavy launches, these happen pretty often, and are often the result of a single change, not always by a highly visible or well-known individual.

Essentially, this is a venue to recognize work that is:

1. Technically excellent;
2. Exemplary of Slack's values;
3. Modest in scope, less than one engineer-week;
4. At risk of being under-recognized.

"These criteria are, necessarily, a matter of opinion. Smart, well-intentioned people will disagree about how any collection of work ranks under this rubric. We're proceeding anyway, in the belief that doing something imperfect-yet-directionally-correct is better than failing to do anything for fear of imperfection."
