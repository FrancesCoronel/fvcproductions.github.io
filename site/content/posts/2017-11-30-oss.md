Although I've been using GitHub for nearly 5 years now, I've only just recently had the chance take the role of a maintainer of active F/OSS through [freeCodeCamp/guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide)

Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.

According to the Linux Foundation, there are actually 4 recognized stages of corporate open source participation.

The 4 stages being Consumption, Participation, Influencing, and Initiation.

But with GitHub, I've broken these stages down even further into 10 different ones.

## Consumption

### 1. celebrity

joins GitHub and immediately gets a crap ton of followers because they're Linux-level famous but don't actually have much activity on GitHub

### 2. newbie

viewing repos

### 3. stargazer

actively starring repos

## Participation

### 4. issue ally

raises issue or comments on issues

### 5. contributing pro

contributing to active projects

### 6. maintainer virtuoso

in charge of reviewing PRs for an active project

## Influencing

### 7. lover

working open source in their free time

### 8. full-timer

open source is their full-time job

### 9. leader

someone who is widely recognized for their open source work on GitHub - think Sindre Sorhus

## Initiation

### 10. GitHubber

decides they love GitHub so much, they join GitHub full-time
