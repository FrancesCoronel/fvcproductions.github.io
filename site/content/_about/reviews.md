## I love getting feedback after mentoring or volunteering opportunities! 😊

I signed my Sedgefield Elementary School classes up for "[The Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us)" this past December 2015\. Ms. Coronel was one of the volunteers I could choose to invite to do a presentation to my 3rd-grade students. She eagerly accepted my invite and planned with me what Newport News Public Schools wants our students to learn, our Citizen, College, and Career ready ideals and connected them to [her unique presentation](https://fvcproductions.com/2015/12/07/hour-of-code-2015/) presented from the aspect of a female Latina. She piqued the interest for all of our students but especially showed our girls that technology and math are not just for the boys.

Ms. Coronel came prepared, was respectful to our staff and students, and helped make it clear that the field of Computer Science is a great field of study for our students to find future well-paying careers.

Frances prepared an excellent [presentation](https://fvcproductions.com/2015/12/07/hour-of-code-2015/) when she volunteered in my classes on December 7th, 2015 during the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) Activity. She was professional and her presentation was instructional and entertaining. She provided students with valuable information about the Computer Science field of study and job market. She also provided assistance to students who needed help with the Hour of Code activities.

I am very grateful to have had Frances as a presenter and her assistance during the Hour of Code in my classes.

When I first saw the type of work FVCproductions was doing, I was immediately convinced I had found my designer. The work was bold, professional and clean. The style was just the theme I wanted to build [my new site](https://www.ameot.com/) around. She was patient and capable, listening to what I wanted and began to bring my ideas to fruition. She was courteous and professional and most of all fair in pricing for the job.

I would recommend FVCproductions to anyone looking to create a web presence for their company or personal brand.

I don’t know if you remember me but we Skyped a while ago. You were nice enough to let me ask you questions and get [advice on the application process](https://fvcproductions.com/2016/03/31/all-the-bootcamp-things/) for [Fullstack](https://fullstackacademy.com). I went into the admissions process with way more confidence and I got in!

So thank you, you were extremely helpful.

## Update

It's Angel! First day of Senior Phase at Fullstack. It's been crazy as hell, but I've learned so much in the past six weeks. Thanks again for all the help!

The class and I would like to thank you and your team for an amazing [CODE](https://hourofcode.com/us)ing experience. [Your presentation](https://fvcproductions.com/2015/12/07/hour-of-code-2015/) was enlightening, and your help was appreciated. To say the kids were excited is an understatement, they were "electrified!". They couldn't stop talking about how fun it was and now that I have a teacher dashboard I can see their progress. I appreciate the instructor handbook and have already found some really cool activities to try. You have inspired the class and their teacher. We couldn't have done it without you.

Thank you for making the journey to our school, and giving us two hours of your time.

I want to thank Frances Coronel and Josh for their leadership and guidance beginning my class in the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us). I was timid in that I have very little knowledge and did not want to turn my students off to this concept by confusing them. They did quite the opposite! The students have been excited and yearning for more! Thank you for your help and keep making a difference!

Frances has been a great help in the process of my web development journey. She showed me what a good web development environment is.

One day, I accidentally went into one of Fullstack Academy‘s classes, other students had no idea with some of the things that Frances showed me. It definitely gave me a head start in my career in web development and helped me pick up things more efficiently throughout the process.

Furthermore, Frances’s broad knowledge in the web development field gave me a structured guideline in prepping for bootcamp applications. Her guidance has nourished me tremendously.

I just got accepted to a bootcamp, and I start my full time web development bootcamp in 2 weeks, and I wouldn’t have gotten where I am without her.

I know Frances will continue to inspire and help other future web developers succeed. I am forever thankful for Frances’s mentorship.

Hey, I emailed you a few months ago asking for some [coding bootcamp interview advice](https://fvcproductions.com/2016/03/31/all-the-bootcamp-things/). I ended up getting accepted into [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/)! I'm on my 5th week and have been having an amazing experience. A fellow classmate noticed today that we were connected on LinkedIn and mentioned he was also a fan of your blog.

Anyway, thanks again for the advice you gave me.

Frances has helped me prepare for my upcoming coding bootcamp - I’ll be part of the inaugural class for [MakerSquare in NYC](https://www.makersquare.com/campuses/new-york-city). She showed me all the cool tricks and skills to make me a better programmer. She took her time and explained the [what, why, and how](https://bit.ly/bootcamp-prep). For example, she showed me how to optimize my dev environment. She also took her time showing me how to overcome challenges I will face in my cohort. I can't thank Frances enough for taking her time and sharing her knowledge with me.

Thank you, Frances!

I had the pleasure to chat with Frances and to receive her guidance on all things related to coding bootcamps and tech careers. She was so generous with her time, and she shared with me the resources and advices that are beneficial to help me prepare for my admission interviews, JavaScript learning tools, and insights on navigating the tech scenes as the beginners. She is the epitome of a "giver"/ caring mentor, and makes the developers' community such a welcoming and inviting place.

Again, my sincere thanks to you and I hope we have the chance to reconnect when you're in NYC!
