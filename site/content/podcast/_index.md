## Why?

So after starting to listen to more tech podcasts, I realized a disappointing trend - most of the hosts were white guys. Overwhelmingly so.

But instead of deciding to complain about the lack of good tech podcasts with POC hosts, I instead decided to start my own.

Introducing **Tech Queens**, a podcast that focuses on stories and advice by women of color in tech.

## Who?

In 2015, women made up 25 percent of computing-related occupations.

As Figure 1.1 indicates, levels of participation are even more concerning when it comes to women of color ([NCWIT - Bureau of Labor, 2016](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf)).

In other words, if you are not a white woman - you're a woman of color in tech and should share your story on Tech Queens!

### The Host

Hi, I'm Frances!

I'm a Latina (Peruvian-American) who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

Or better yet, I'm a [unicorn](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unicorn_(finance)>) (1% of women in tech identify as Latina) who is working for another unicorn ([Slack](https://slack.com)). ðŸ¦„

You can find more deets on my [about page](/about).
