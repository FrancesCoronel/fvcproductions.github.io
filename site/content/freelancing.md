## I work with clients of all backgrounds on both product design & development.

> I also freelance write every now and then.

### Provisions

Whatever your needs are related to web design & development or blog writing, I will work with you every step of the way to ensure you get the best quality output.

To get a better idea of what I have to offer, feel free to look through a [few samples from my blog](/blog), [portfolio](/portfolio), and [feedback](/services/reviews) given from folks I've worked with in the past.

### Process

1.  You contact me through my website with some details about what your needs are.
2.  I will [set up a time to meet](https://calendly.com/fvcproductions) so we can discuss the project further as well as pricing.
3.  A contract will be set up [through Bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com) and iteration starts. This will involve you receiving consistent updates on the project and an overview of the hours I've worked through [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com).
4.  Once you're happy with the final changes and payments are finalized [via PayPal](https://paypal.me/fvcproductions) or your method of choice, the project is complete!
