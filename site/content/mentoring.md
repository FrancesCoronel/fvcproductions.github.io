## I enjoy mentoring folks through non-profit organizations trying to enact change in the tech industry.

> As of **August 2018**, I am slowly losing track of all the mentoring activity I've been up to, however, my [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions) is the most up to date.
>
> As of **June 2018**, I‚Äôve dedicated **over 55 hours** of my free time mentoring awesome people 1-on-1 which you can see on the [mentoring sessions](#mentoring-sessions) section below ‚è∞
>
> As of **February 2018**, I've [started mentoring part-time](/2018/02/20/thinkful/) for Thinkful's web development bootcamp and getting paid to do so. üòä

Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools.

So far, I‚Äôve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com), [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com), and [MakerSquare](https://makersquare.com).

I‚Äôve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field.

You can find [the feedback I've received](/feedback/ "Feedback") thus far on my website!
