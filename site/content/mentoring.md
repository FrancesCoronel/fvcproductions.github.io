## I enjoy mentoring folks through non-profit organizations trying to enact change in the tech industry.

Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools.

So far, I've helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com), [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com), and [MakerSquare](https://makersquare.com).

I've also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field.
