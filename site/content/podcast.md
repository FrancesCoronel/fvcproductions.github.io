## Why?

So after starting to listen to more tech podcasts, I realized a disappointing trend - most of the hosts were white guys. Overwhelmingly so.

But instead of deciding to complain about the lack of good tech podcasts with POC hosts, I instead decided to start my own.

> Introducing **Tech Queens**, a podcast that focuses on stories and advice by women of color in tech. `#TechQueens`

## Who?

In 2015, women made up 25 percent of computing-related occupations. As Figure 1.1 indicates, levels
of participation are even more concerning when it comes to women of color (Bureau of Labor, 2016).

In other words, if you are not a white woman - you a minority woman in tech.

### The Host ðŸ¦„

Hi, I'm Frances!

I'm a Latina who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

Or better yet, I'm a [unicorn](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unicorn_(finance)>) (1% of women in tech identify as Latina) who is working for another unicorn ([Slack](https://slack.com)).
