<!-- ## Transcript

Hello and welcome to Progressive Web Apps 101!

You have all been automatically enrolled in this short but sweet 25 minute course.

Throughout the course, we will explore the wide array of companies that have already benefited from the many enhancements PWAs offer and I will walk you through the steps of transforming an existing website into a Progressive Web App from the bottom up.

To be successful, the pre-reqs are HTML & JS 101 which I’m pretty sure you all have.

A brief intro before we get started - I’m Frances Coronel.

I just got a new job with Slack at their headquarters in SF which I start in two weeks - super exciting. I also work part-time as a technical mentor for Thinkful students. If you’re not familiar, Slack is this startup that offers this great collaboration platform for teams of all kinds and Thinkful is a very popular online coding bootcamp.

Before this, I worked & interned with Accenture which is this huge consulting company and before that, I studied CS at Cornell Tech, Hampton University and also just studied in general at Fullstack Academy, Designlab and Product School.

I was born and raised in Norfolk, VA so it is nice to be back on the East Coast. Norfolk is home to the largest naval base in the world. -->
