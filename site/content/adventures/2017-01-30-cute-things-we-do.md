I felt like doing something non-traditional for Valentine's day so I made my boyfriend this website showcasing a few pictures from dates we've had together.

The logo is a really cute picture of my dog because yeah why not.

Even though I originally had the domain [cutethingswedo.com](https://cutethingswedo.com) for this, I only paid for a year so yeah **RIP** - it's a GitHub page now!
