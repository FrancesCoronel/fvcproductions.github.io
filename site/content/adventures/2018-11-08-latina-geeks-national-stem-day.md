LatinaGeeks, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is the first-of-its-kind community to empower and inspire Latin women by spreading the knowledge of entrepreneurship, social media and technology. We provide our  community with the latest gadget reviews, mobile applications, social technology and local tech-startups that women can apply to their daily lives and/or business.

"It is National STEM Day, a national holiday meant to encourage individuals of all ages to think about the world of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM)."
