## Here's a little riddle that is based on a very recognized riddle, except it uses POTC references.

So basically it's like [Star Trek Monopoly](https://www.amazon.com/USAopoly-MN066-201-Monopoly-Star-Continuum/dp/B001SN8G8G 'Star Trek Monopoly'), a spoof of the original.

Made it up on by own and really love it so hope you do too.

You are Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow of the Black Pearl, and are on a journey to discover untold riches of the long gone Spanish pirate Benito de Soto.

His vast amount of gold doubloons is said to be hidden in Tortuga cave on a remote island called Monte Cristo.

You finally find the cave and immediately encounter 3 chests along with many skeletal corpses surrounding the water around the chests.

One chest is labeled "gold doubloons", the other "silver doubloons", and the last one "gold and silver doubloons".

As you head towards the gold doubloons chest, the phantom of Benito de Soto comes up to you with his sword and challenges you to his battle of the wits that many have failed .

You bravely accept his challenge and he tells you that,

> "Each chest has been incorrectly labeled. You must chose one doubloon from one chest so that you may be then afterwards correctly label the chests. IF you cheat or fail to correctly label the chests, then you will die a miserable death and replace me as phantom. IF, however, you succeed, you may leave and take my gold doubloons with you."

Assuming that the phantom is telling the truth, how will you, Captain Jack Sparrow, label the chests correctly and avoid certain death??

## ANSWER

Open the chest that is labeled "Gold & Silver Doubloons".

You know that since none of the labels are correct, that chest must either contain _only silver doubloons_, or _only gold doubloons_.

Knowing this...

> If you find gold doubloons in that chest you opened, that chest can be correctly labelled as "Gold Doubloons", and then the chest labelled as "Silver Doubloons" is the chest that contains "Gold & Silver Doubloons", and the chest labelled as "Gold Doubloons" is the chest that contains "Silver Doubloons"

OR

> Vice versa, if you find silver doubloons in that chest you opened, that chest can be correctly labelled as "Silver Doubloons" and then the chest labelled as "Gold Doubloons" is the chest that contains "Gold & Silver Doubloons", and the chest labelled as "Silver Doubloons" is the chest that contains "Gold Doubloons"

So if you were able to figure it out, HUZZAH! Here's Jack congratulating you on a job well done.
