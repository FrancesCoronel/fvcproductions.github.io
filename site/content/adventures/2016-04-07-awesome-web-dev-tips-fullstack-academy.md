## 1. Making Sublime Sexy

> Let’s start by installing Package Control!

To note.. ST3 > WebStorm > Vim.

### Package Control

The de facto Sublime Text package manager with over 2,500 packages available for installation, all available in GitHub or BitBucket repos.

#### Installing Package Control

Go here: https://packagecontrol.io/installation

#### Installing Packages

⌘ ⇧ P

`Command + Shift + P`

#### Installing a Certain Package

Enter To Install The Highlighted Package & You’re Done!

### Themes

To make your dev environment purty.

#### Installing Themes

This article basically covers everything.

So basically... use the Package Manager.

Make sure to include the code in your **User Settings** file which can be found under `Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings - User`.

For example, if you installed the Theme ITG Flat, then this is how you would modify your User Settings file to have the dark version of the theme and color scheme.

These instructions will be in the Theme’s documentation on their GitHub repo.

```json
{
  "color-scheme": "Packages/Theme - itg.flat/itg.dark.tmTheme",
  "theme": "itg.flat.dark.sublime-theme"
}
```

### Magical Packages

> You’re a wizard now.

Also, some of these just work with ST3.

#### Bracket Highlighter

Matches a variety of cases such as `[]`, `{}`, `()`, `""`, `''`, `<tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

#### GitGutter

Shows an icon in the gutter area indicating whether a line has been inserted, modified, or deleted.

#### SublimeLinter

Shows where possible syntax errors could be.

For JavaScript (JSHint), go here.

For more JS stuff, go here.

#### HTML-CSS-JS Prettify

Prettify your code.

#### Markdown Editing

Powerful editing features for all you Markdown lovers.

#### AutoFileName

Autocomplete file naming for lazy people.

#### Sublime CodeIntel

Full featured code intelligence and smart autocomplete engine.

#### Sidebar Enhancements

Makes your sidebar more powerful.

#### Codeiviate

Insight, motivation, and benchmarking for programmers.

#### Want more?

Learn from the best of the best.

Seriously, there’s an entire series from the Google Developers YouTube team dedicated to cool plugins.

## 2. Messing with the Terminal

If you want to feel like a hacker just because though, go here and start typing away!

### Creating Aliases in Terminal/iTerm

Type in `nano .bash_profile`.

Then type in `alias [insert alias name here] = "cd ~/[insert path here]"`.

i.e. `alias cdfsa = "cd ~/Dropbox/GitHub/FSA"`

Make sure to restart your terminal after you add the alias(es).

### No more sudo.

Type this in your Terminal app so you don’t have to type sudo before every npm install command.

`sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`

This may not work in Zsh.

### Add subl to open files in Terminal using Sublime Text 3

Type this in your Terminal app so you can open files in ST3.

`ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime`

Source

This doesn’t work with ST2.

### "Bada\*\*ify" your terminal & shell with oh-my-zsh

Wes Bos also has a Command Line Power User YouTube Playlist!

### A Random Cool Bash Profile

INSERT HERE

### Add syntax highlighting to command line Mongo queries.
