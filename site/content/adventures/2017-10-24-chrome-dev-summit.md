### Why I Love the Web

```text
On the way to work, in our homes, offices and fields, in times of peace, conflict and emergencies, radio remains a crucial source of information and knowledge, spanning generations and cultures, inspiring us with the wealth of humanity's diversity, and connecting us with the world.

Radio is still the most dynamic, reactive and engaging medium there is, adapting to 21st century changes and offering new ways to interact and participate.

- UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova
```

**But I believe the web can become the next radio by becoming the most accessible platform for every human being on the planet.**
