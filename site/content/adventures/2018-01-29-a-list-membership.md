## A-List is a platform that helps top startups quickly interview the top-ranked tech talent on AngelList.

A-List is sourced from over 3 million profiles, identified by algorithms and curated by humans. Under 1% of candidates qualify.

They built an algorithm that selects recently active candidates and gives them a score based on work experience, education, and skills. The A-List team then goes through the candidates with high scores and selects who to invite.

A-List is currently only for for top software engineers & designers open to full time opportunities in SF & NY.
