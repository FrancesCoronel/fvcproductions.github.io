  When I was in the process of applying to a ton of coding bootcamps, I came
  across DevLeague.

  They were kind enough to feature my blog post on my interview experience
  with them on their own website through their blog. I thought they were
  some of the nicest people I came across when the coding bootcamp interview
  process and definitely appreciate how theyâ€™re the only coding bootcamp in
  Hawaii.

  AAAI is pleased to announce the continuation of its Student Scholarship
  Program for 2016, which is sponsored by the AI Journal. The Student
  Scholar Program provides partial travel support for students who are
  full-time undergraduate or graduate students at colleges and universities;
  are members of AAAI; submit papers to the conference program or letters of
  recommendation from their faculty advisor; and submit scholarship
  applications to AAAI by November 30, 2015. In addition, repeat scholarship
  applicants must have fulfilled the volunteer and reporting requirements
  for previous awards. In the event that scholarship applications exceed
  available funds, preference will be given to students who have an accepted
  technical paper, and then to students who are actively participating in
  the conference in some way. However, all eligible students are encouraged
  to apply. After the conference, an expense report will be required to
  account for the funds awarded.

  The Student Volunteer Program is an essential part of the conference and
  student participation is a valuable contribution. Volunteers will support
  AAAI organizers in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2016, a limited number of
  complimentary technical program registrations will be available for
  students who volunteer during the conference. Preference will be given to
  participating students for the volunteer positions. Local students or
  students not requiring travel assistance can apply for the Volunteer
  Program if openings are available. AAAI membership is required for
  eligibility. The deadline for volunteer applications is November 30, 2015.
