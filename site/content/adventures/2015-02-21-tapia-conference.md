## About

The Tapia conference has always been a premier venue to acknowledge, to promote and to celebrate diversity in computing.

The goal of the Tapia Conferences is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, researchers, and professionals in computing from all backgrounds and ethnicities to:

* Celebrate the diversity that exists in computing;
* Connect with others with common backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and gender so as to create communities that extend beyond the conference;
* Obtain advice from and make contacts with computing leaders in academia and industry;
* Be inspired by great presentations and conversations with leaders with common backgrounds.
