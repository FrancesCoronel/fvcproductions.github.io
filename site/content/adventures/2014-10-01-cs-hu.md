## Overview

As the Website Committee Chair for my ACM club at Hampton, I created the website at [`huacm.wordpress.com`](https://huacm.wordpress.com "CS@HU") to build a stronger community around the CS department.

In addition to being in charge of the website, I’m also in charge of maintaining all other social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, GitHub), the Typeforms, the [introductory GitBook](https://bit.ly/hu-book "GitBook"), organization branding, meeting presentations, the calendar, etc. for the CS@HU department/ACM@HU club.

> The website was first created in `October 2014` under my role as the Website Committee Chair for the ACM club at HU.
