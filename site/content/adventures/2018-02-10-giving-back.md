## I love open-source. 🌐

And given that open source is so ubiquitous now within the tech industry and basically lays the foundation for all the applications we know and love, you probably should too! 😊

I love sharing everything I've worked on without expecting anything in return and I love it when I benefit from others who have done the same.

**BUT** for far too long (I joined GitHub in 2013), I have been consuming open-source projects and allowed myself to reap all the benefits others have put hard work into. 😓

### So I'm finally deciding to put my money where my heart is and start giving back to the open-source community. 💛

So I'm donating 2 bucks each month indefinitely to future [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) development. I know it's not a lot in the grand scheme of things but damn, I just got out of college so I'm not rich people. 💸

I actually ended up being the first sponsor for `docsify` which describes itself as a "magical documentation site generator". 🔮

<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Now _magical_ may seem like an exaggeration but `docsify` seriously does make it as easy as _fuck_ for anyone with basic knowledge of JS and Markdown to create a beautiful and responsive documentation site.

### I encourage everyone to [pay it forward](https://opencollective.com) and make a small donation to your favorite open-source project or [docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify) just because it's amazing! 🎉
