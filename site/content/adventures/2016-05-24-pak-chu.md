Frances has helped me prepare for my upcoming coding bootcamp - I'll be part of the inaugural class for [MakerSquare in NYC](https://makersquare.com/campuses/new-york-city). She showed me all the cool tricks and skills to make me a better programmer. She took her time and explained the [what, why, and how](https://bit.ly/bootcamp-prep). For example, she showed me how to optimize my dev environment. She also took her time showing me how to overcome challenges I will face in my cohort. I can't thank Frances enough for taking her time and sharing her knowledge with me.

Thank you, Frances!
