Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization devoted to getting women the materials they need to pursue careers in software development.

* I was on a panel with three other speakers for a GDI SF Meetup on "Women in Open Source" where I talked about my involvement with open source and how one can get more involved hosted at Unity's HQ in San Francisco on June 26th, 2018 from 6 pm to 8:30 pm.
