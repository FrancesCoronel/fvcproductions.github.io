I reached out to Frances because I admire all of that she has accomplished. She gave me the confidence I needed to keep pressing forward as I continue my job hunt in the tech industry. She was kind enough to provide really helpful feedback on my LinkedIn, personal website, and resume. Her career advice and feedback was invaluable. She really cares about helping people find their way in the tech industry.

I canâ€™t thank you enough, Frances! You are truly inspiring!
