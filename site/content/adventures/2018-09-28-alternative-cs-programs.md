> Originally planned for release on April 10th, 2017 but stuff happens.

After interviewing with a few of the new and upcoming alternative long-term programs for CS education, I wanted to provide others a brief overview of how they operate differently.

Most coding bootcamps are 2 to 4 months (8 to 12 weeks) long.

These programs instead act as alternative options to a CS degree which is usually 4 years long.

> Common Patterns Found

- gamification
- thorough admissions process
- all these programs will accept someone who is at least 18 years but some of them have upper age limits

- [Syllabus for the 1st year of their program](https://holbertonschool.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/syllabus/holberton_school_syllabus_03082017010101.pdf)
- 2 years
- 18+
- San Francisco, CA
- internet projects with deadlines - always released at midnight
- no formal lectures/teachers
- access to resources that have more experience and knowledge
- overlapping batches
- staff here on-site who write most of the projects anyways
- mentors who are available in a number of different channels (emails, slack, meetups (fireside chats), in-person)
- no formal teacher - just uses mentor to provide up to date knowledge on whatever they're working on
- i.e. mentor who is a man who works in cyber-security in SF (Dave) - look over my resume
- networking really important component of those who come in
- constant feedback on program and how it is relevant in industry
- we cannot implement things that we think are important - so whatever we're teaching here - they have to be relevant for industry
- mentors critique curriculum and provide feedback in different roles/companies
- huge sense of comraderie and teamwork and collaboration --> important for us too
- current student interviewing me
- help other students --> status quo
- focuses community, collaboration, and helping others, sharing knowledge
- 1st 9 months --> 60 hours a week --> on-site intensive learning
  - first 3 months
    - theories, fundamentals
    - C programming languages
    - projects build up
      - last one is "building a shell"
  - next 3 months
    - front-end
    - back-end
    - APIs
    - databases
    - uses Python
    - not about learning Python but about understanding methods/routes and
      understanding OOP fundamental concepts so you could easily translate that
      syntax
    - C projects don't stop
  - next 3 months
    - systems administration
    - devops
  - next 6 months
    - full-time internship
      - this can turn into job
    - full-time job
- next 9 months
  - full-time specialization
  - part-time
  - if a bunch of people in your cohort are interested in something specific -
    then that is a specialization that is created - has to be at least 4 people in
    a specialization
  - no set group of specializations because industry changes every year
  - specializations now: low-level algorithms, back-end engineering, system
    administration/devops/SRE (site reliability engineer)
  - specialization can be done part-time --> meant with full-time job
  - others are back full-time with specialization b/c they didn't get full-time
    job after 6 months or they choose hiatus/quit
  - majority choose part-time
- cohort demographics (January 2017)
  - 50% female, 30 or 40%
  - 50% POC
- average age range
  - most of students are in mid-20s to 30s
  - right out of high school
  - at least 18
  - 40's, 50's, 58 is oldest we've gotten
- are any of projects given by a contract
  - all are created by staff here
  - staff members are not experts in front-end/UX/UI field
  - so some you can collaborate with mentors
- can you give me examples of jobs folks from your cohort have gotten
  - systems administration/devops roles
  - 2 people with Apple doing SRE
  - 2 people with Dropbox doing SRE
  - 1 with Docker as SWE
  - 1 with LinkedIn as SWE
  - 2 people with medical tech company as SWE intern
  - full-time jobs right after Holberton but it's definitely not the expectation
  - 3 with scality as junior SWE
