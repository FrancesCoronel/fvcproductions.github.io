Techqueria is one of the largest Latinx in tech organizations in the US, with a presence in the Bay Area, LA, and NYC.

I helped revamp their entire website using Hugo which can be currently found at https://techqueria.org.

After a couple of months, I was finally able to launch a new version of Techqueria's website! üéâ
