## About

I had an AMAZING time!!

I tried something new this time and decided to live tweet what I was experiencing.

In terms of my personal agenda, besides the main talks, I also attended the "Women in Color" breakfast in the morning and then I chose to attend the "Communicate with Confidence" workshop later on in the day. It worked out really well because I was able to pick up a hardware kit from the Android workshops for free. 😊

The branding for this event was exquisite by the way - so clean and calm! See what I mean below.

And after I had the opportunity to get my headshot taken, I was so happy with the final results that I changed my profile photo/header picture to match on both LinkedIn & Twitter - I'm loving the watercolor!! 🌊️
