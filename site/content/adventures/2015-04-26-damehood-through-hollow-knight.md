## Back in December of last year, I was browsing through Kickstarter - eager to spend my limited college student cash on something awesome. I found [Hollow Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight 'Hollow Knight').

So I ended up coming across a project called [Hollow Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight 'Hollow Knight'). I decided I wasn't ready to commit and told Kickstarter to **Remind Me** later to see if I still wanted to back up. The video was beyond amazing, but I was just a little unsure if my 2nd investment on Kickstarter should be in a 2D game.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2amTl5lBYM">Hollow Knight Trailer</a></h4><p>Hollow Knight is a 2D adventure game for PC, Mac and Linux, currently in development by Team Cherry http://teamcherry.com.au/hollowknight/ Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps an ancient, forgotten kingdom. Many are drawn beneath the surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to old secrets.</p></blockquote>

Anyhow, they later email me on December 16, 2015 at 9:02 pm, asking if I'd still like to help out since their project period was ending soon.

Exactly 25 minutes later, I decide that yes, I'm definitely backing these guys up.

It was only 10 bucks and you know what, that artwork is to **DIE FOR**.

Also, the video's soundtrack music kind of hypnotized me, beckoning me to follow the strange little bug creatures/beetle thingies. That soundtrack can be downloaded over at [Incompetech.com](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ 'Incompetech') by searching for `Plans in Motion`, the title.

It loses the highly disjointed theme, and takes on a smoother note.</p></blockquote>

Anyways, I'm really really looking forward to achieving damehood. The full game for OS X should be coming out until June, so until then, I guess I'll just be fan girling or what have you.

Can't wait!
