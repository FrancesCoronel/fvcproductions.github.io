This is a venue to recognize work that took place this week that we feel is:

1. Technically excellent;
2. Exemplary of Slack's values;
3. Modest in scope, less than one engineer-week;
4. At risk of being under-recognized.
   These criteria are, necessarily, a matter of opinion. Smart, well-intentioned people will disagree about how any collection of work ranks under this rubric. We're proceeding anyway, in the belief that doing something imperfect-yet-directionally-correct is better than failing to do anything for fear of imperfection. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ping the current WotW czar, Mike Demmer (@demmer).

Reminder: :eyes*right: :white_check_mark: Hey! Have you seen a noteworthy bug fix or PR this week that addresses an internal or customer need? Was there a particularly gnarly issue or impactful resolution handled in triage this week? \_If so, please recognize your sibs with a Win of the Week nomination.* Submit a description of the effort via http://wotw.club/, or just use the :wotw: reacji on a message that references the PR or work.

:trophy: Remember, _anyone_ can submit a nomination for great work that you see happen within the team and across the eng org. :trophy:

Hello engineering! Starting this week, we’re kicking a program we’re calling _WIN OF THE WEEK_.

The point of this project is to increase visibility of, and to some extent socialize the possibility of, big wins coming from regular, solid, individual efforts on non-herculean scope. Unlike large, heavy launches, these happen pretty often, and are often the result of a single change, not always by a highly visible or well-known individual.

HOW IT WORKS.

• At the end of the week, managers will nominate candidates for the WotW. If you have a nomination, please tell your manager.
• From our weekly nomination list, Keith will pick a WotW which we’ll broadcast on Monday.
•The recipient will receive a special prize to keep as well as _one week ownership of the coveted Win of the Week trophy_. While this trophy is still being built, we do know what adorns the top of it. _Against his wishes_, the Win of the Week trophy is capped by famed Cal Bobblehead – pizza shoes and all. #sweet.
