Collaborated with one other team member to create a virtual portal for [Fullstack Academy](//fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy') students and interested companies to explore projects and hackathons as well as create their own profiles and set up hiring event preferences using the [stable marriage algorithm](//www.wikiwand.com/en/Stable_marriage_problem 'stable marriage algorithm') using [the MEAN stack](//mean.io 'MEAN stack').

This project was completed on `August 26th, 2015` for the Capstone phase of [Fullstack Academy](//fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy').
