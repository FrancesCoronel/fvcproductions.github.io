# Overview

Collaborated with one other team member to create a virtual portal for [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy") students and interested companies to explore projects and hackathons as well as create their own profiles and set up hiring event preferences using the [stable marriage algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stable_marriage_problem "stable marriage algorithm") using [the MEAN stack](https://mean.io "MEAN stack").

> This project was completed on `August 26th, 2015` for the Capstone phase of [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy").
