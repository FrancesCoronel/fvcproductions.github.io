# Overview

I developed a web app (still in **BETA**) that ranks coding bootcamps based on social and rating score based on data crawled from various sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, Course Report, Facebook, AngelList, Google+, etc.) using [Cheerio](//github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio 'Cheerio') and [the MEAN stack](//mean.io 'MEAN stack').

This project was completed on `August 11th, 2015` for the Stackathon phase of [Fullstack Academy](//fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy').

## Future Features

* Calculating Techendo average rating fairly.
* Calculate number of **unique** reviews from each provider, but donâ€™t actually copy the reviews over.
* Better comments so others can easily contribute.
* Get links to other links from Course Report so less links are needed and scraping is faster.
