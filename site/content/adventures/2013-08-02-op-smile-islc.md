## About

This was my second international conference with Operation Smile.

I really enjoyed this conference because I was able to bring in a lot of my fellow members from the Operation Smile Club at Maury High School where I was the VP.

It was conveniently located in my hometown of Norfolk and marked my final piece of involvement with Operation Smile since I had just graduated from high school.
