### On June 18th, the 2nd Thursday of Fullstack Academy, I realized a lot of my partners for pair programming would ask me similar questions regarding my dev environment so I started making a deck of some tips and tricks that I felt would have proven valuable for me back in the day.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="http://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/awesome-web-dev-tips-and-tricks">Awesome Web Dev Tips & Tricks</a></h4><p>Making Sublime Sexy, Themes, Packages, Customizing Your Terminal, Cool OSX Apps, Nifty Chrome Extensions, Wicked Websites, Funsies, and other awesome resources. First created June 18th, 2015 at Fullstack Academy of Code. Update July 27th, 2016: This slide deck is shared with all new joiners of Fullstack and Grace Hopper via email!</p></blockquote>

### Then today, I was part of the first group that had to present a Tech Talk, a 10 minute talk every student has to give on a tech topic at some point during the senior phase of Fullstack.

# It's terribly crazy how busy I've been. I still haven't even finished my blog post for Week 7 or 8, which itself is about to end soon. These are interesting times. I'll have to catch up... at some point.
