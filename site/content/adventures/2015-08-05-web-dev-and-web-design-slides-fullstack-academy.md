### On June 18th, the 2nd Thursday of Fullstack Academy, I realized a lot of my partners for pair programming would ask me similar questions regarding my dev environment so I started making a deck of some tips and tricks that I felt would have proven valuable for me back in the day.

### Then today, I was part of the first group that had to present a Tech Talk, a 10 minute talk every student has to give on a tech topic at some point during the senior phase of Fullstack.

# It's terribly crazy how busy I've been. I still haven't even finished my blog post for Week 7 or 8, which itself is about to end soon. These are interesting times. I'll have to catch up... at some point.
