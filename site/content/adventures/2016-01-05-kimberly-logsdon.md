I want to thank Frances Coronel and Josh for their leadership and guidance beginning my class in the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us). I was timid in that I have very little knowledge and did not want to turn my students off to this concept by confusing them. They did quite the opposite! The students have been excited and yearning for more! Thank you for your help and keep making a difference!
