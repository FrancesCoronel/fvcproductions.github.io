I was part of the backstage crew for "The Chinese Wall" play at Jacobs University Bremen.

In addition to being in charge of everything marketing related, I was also in charge of all the special sound effects.

After the experience, I realized being in charge of audio for a play is super boring but that creating brochures and flyers and what not was enjoyable.
