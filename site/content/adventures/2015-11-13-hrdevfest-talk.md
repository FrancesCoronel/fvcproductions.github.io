So I live in Norfolk, Virginia which is this beautiful small town by the sea. Norfolk is part of the Hampton Roads area which is often referred to as the `757` since that's our catchy area code.

![Norfolk, VA](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/forbestravelguide/files/2015/08/0820_FL-norfolk-virginia-skyline_2000x1125-1152x648.jpg)

Norfolk has a growing developer community, but it has yet to really establish a culture for them. This is where conferences usually come in.

Having said that, **[HR DevFest](https://hrdevfest.org 'HRDevFest')**, the **first major tech conference catering to the `757` area**, was actually **today** on November 14th, 2015 from 8:30 am to 6 pm.

It's always exciting to potentially be part of an inaugural anything so when the organizers behind HR DevFest announced their call for presentations, I decided to give it a shot for the heck of it and submitted my proposal on a web design talk that I had presented while at [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy').

I was surprised by the amount of support I received from the community for the proposal and before I knew it, I had gotten the opportunity to speak for the first time at an official tech conference.

<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

I've spoken at conferences before, but never at an actual tech conference which is why victory was that much sweeter when I finally got the opportunity to do so today. So...

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/fvcproductions/status/662647429737615360">Frances Coronel on Twitter</a></h4><p>I'll speaking at @HRDevFest on web design this Saturday - should be a blast! #webdesign #hrdevfest</p></blockquote>
