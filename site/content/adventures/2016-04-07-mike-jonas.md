Hey, I emailed you a few months ago asking for some [coding bootcamp interview advice](https://fvcproductions.com/2016/03/31/all-the-bootcamp-things/). I ended up getting accepted into [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com/)! I'm on my 5th week and have been having an amazing experience. A fellow classmate noticed today that we were connected on LinkedIn and mentioned he was also a fan of your blog.

Anyway, thanks again for the advice you gave me.
