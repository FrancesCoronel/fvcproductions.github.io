Hey Frances,

Thanks for the info! My name is Chris Lanus, and while I'm not interested in new opportunities at the moment (I'm happily employed as a front-end developer in Chicago), I just wanted to introduce myself.

In particular, I wanted to let you know that when I was researching bootcamps, I ended up finding your blog detailing your time and experience at Fullstack. Your blog was a fantastic resource in helping me choose to pursue the bootcamp path, and Fullstack specifically, as I was decided if/how to make a career transition from high school educator to software developer. Thought you might appreciate knowing that your words were read and were influential!

Thank you!
Chris Lanus
