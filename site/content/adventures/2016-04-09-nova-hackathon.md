### Blog Post

As a speaker at [conferences](https://capwic.org/conference-details/birds-of-a-feather/), [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/NorfolkJS/events/227490794/), and most recently [hackathons](https://novahackathon.org), I've had the opportunity so far to talk about topics like [JS (JavaScript) Coding Bootcamps](https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/hrdevfest-web-design), [Coding Bootcamps (targeted at women in tech)](https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/capwic-2016), and [Web Design](https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/hrdevfest-web-design).

But earlier this month, I got the opportunity to speak at the first annual [Innovation Hackathon](https://www.novahackathon.org/) located at [Northern Virginia Community College's (NOVA) brand new Regional Center for Workforce Education and Training](https://www.nvcc.edu/rcwet/) (quite a mouthful).

I found about the In[NOVA](https://www.nvcc.edu/)tion hackathon through [MLH](https://mlh.io) and earlier this year when I was browsing through which hackathons I could potentially attend, I noticed on their website that they were looking for speakers.

I figured, hey, why not, and after meeting up with the the main guy in charge - [Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-mitchell-4ab60077) (cool dude) - I originally planned on speaking about JS Coding Bootcamps and Web Design (I'd be giving two separate talks).

After a while though, I thought to myself, "Wait a second, Frances! You're going to be speaking at your first hackathon! You can't just recycle an old topic like that. Plus, I doubt a lot of kids in community college really want to think about attending a JS coding bootcamp in the first place.".

I decided I'd talk about something a lot more broad that could appeal to lots of tech-savvy folks, whether the [Innovation Hackathon](https://www.novahackathon.org/) was their very first or they were a hackathon veteran.

> So naturally, my topic of choice ended up being wizardry. More specifically, the presentation was dubbed " [So You Want To A Wizard](https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard)".

_...because wizards and developers happen to have a lot in common._

This presentation covered all your standard wizardry topics, like

![So You Want To A Wizard 4](https://i.imgur.com/0PoPdnY.jpg)

- **muggles** (the difference between creators and consumers),
- **houses** (what kind of software developer positions you can go into),
- **flying** (what you can do to become a better developer),
- **potions** (what specific tools are out there to help you become a better developer),
- **the dark arts** (your real reasoning behind wanting to become a developer),
- and a hearty **conclusion** (ultimately you should forge your own path).

I got a pretty good response from the audience, with quite a few folks coming up sometime afterwards letting me know they enjoyed it or if I had any more advice for so and so. All in all, I really enjoyed going to the hackathon and I think the team did excellently in setting it up in a really modern spacious building despite the weather conditions (it got frosty).

So cheers to the Innovation Hackathon!

As a wizard myself, I can definitely appreciate a well done hackathon.
