# So this week, I signed up as a `technical volunteer` for the [**Hour of Code**](https://hourofcode.com/us).

---

[Code.org](http://code.org) is sponsoring a whole week (December 7th to 13th) of CS education through their Hour of Code event.

Quite a few schools reached out to me, but, of course, I couldn’t volunteer with some of them due to constraints in my class schedule or because they were just too far away.

I, along with [an ODU student](http://thecbliss.com/), decided to go ahead and even attend a [**Professional Development Workshop**](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) for the Hour of Code so we could be better prepared to assist the kids. The session was held at [CAML Academy](http://camlacademy.com/) in North Carolina and was roughly **3.5 hours away**.Thankfully, it was a Saturday.

> And free swag!

## So in the end, I decided to volunteer throughout the week for 4 different schools: [Bethel High School](//bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), [Sedgefield Elementary School](//sedgefield.nn.k12.va.us/), [John B. Dey Elementary School](//www.deyes.vbschools.com/), and [Tallwood Elementary School](//www.tallwoodes.vbschools.com/).

![Hour of Code - Banner](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/hourofcode1-e1449524689973.jpg)

I created two different presentations, one for _high schoolers_ and one for _elementary schoolers_.

## Hour of Code Presentations

### High School Version

At [`Bethel High School`](//bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), I presented and helped out with **3 classes** that were all taught by `Mrs. Ai Choo Ashe`. I gave a roughly 30-minute presentation to each class using the slides below. The classes were related to digital media/game development/animation so the students were learning how to use software like GameMaker & Adobe Photoshop. I gave away all my free swag I got from Code.org to Mrs. Ashe because she deserved it. I kept the water bottle and a sticker, though. They were too useful to pass up.

### Elementary School Version

At [`Sedgefield Elementary School`](//bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), I gave a presentation to a class of 3rd graders on why it’s important to learn how to code. The teachers in charge were so nice and supportive of the kids. I found it funny how much more the 3rd graders participated than the high schoolers, but hey.
