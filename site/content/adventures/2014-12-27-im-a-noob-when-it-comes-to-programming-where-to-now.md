# Here, I've compiled a list of 15 great resources I've come to learn about over the years of trying to learn how to properly program.

I still consider myself a _noob_ now (I mean, it's only been 3 years!), but I grow more and more comfortable with the idea that I've never going to know everything and that aspiring to be a great programmer is the same as aspiring to improve yourself constantly everyday in the art. It's what I love about the field and so I hope this list helps you out in your journey into the realm of digital hieroglyphics (as I like to call it) too.

15. [HTML & CSS](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com)

    > Programming books can often look rather intimidating and uninspiring, but they do not need to be. We wanted to redesign the tech book and make it more accessible, relevant, and attractive to a whole new group of readers. The result is a book that feels more like a magazine and is enjoyable to flick through, and looks like it belongs in the graphic design section rather than the programming section of a bookstore.
