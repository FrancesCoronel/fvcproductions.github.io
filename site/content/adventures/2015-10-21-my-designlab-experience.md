## What is Designlab?

![Designlab - Logo](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/designlab-logo.png)

> [Designlab](//trydesignlab.com) is the best way to learn web and mobile design skills online.
>
> Practice the principles of visual design, UX (user experience), and UI (user interface) design with our project-based, mentor-driven online courses.
>
> Learn concepts and theory from our curated resources, practice with hands-on projects, and get expert feedback on your work from design mentors.
>
> Design is the difference. Set yourself apart.

I decided to take the **[Design 101](//trydesignlab.com/web-design-course/)** course on Designlab to get a better understanding of how design can be incorporated into my work.

You can view the syllabus [here](//storage.trydesignlab.com/syllabus/design-101.pdf).

## Date & Times

**Start Date** = Friday - August 28, 2015

**End Date** = Friday - October 9, 2015

**Actual End Date** = Sunday - October 18, 2015

Even though it ended October 9, it took me another 9 days to finish everything up.

So, finally, on Sunday, October 18th, I managed to finish all the required coursework - woot, woot!

## Swag

![Designlab - Swag](https//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/designlab-swag.jpg)

I received a few items in the mail August 31st - ooh la la. The book "Steal Like An Artist" was included as part of the package and even though I had read it already, it was nice having a physical copy. Even my mom ended up reading it and will quote from the book now and then.

## My Mentor

![Designlab - Mentor](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/designlab-mentor.png)

My mentor, [Chad](//chadtrutt.com/ "Chad Trutt") was pretty cool. I checked out his website and he has some killer work, like this pepper:

![Low-Poly Chilli Pepper](https://m2.behance.net/rendition/pm/17019797/disp/d7e391ee6a819bdc0bdb3cf9eb6bed0c.jpg)

But to be honest, we only ended up Skyping each other once because I was always busy or had something going on that was of higher priority. This was on me.

Regardless, becoming the marvelous mentor he is, Chad always made sure to give me helpful feedback, even after the course was technically over for me! :)

## The Lessons

![Designlab - Week 1](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/designlab-week1.png)

These are already on their website, but I will share again here.

1. Getting to Know Design 2. Visual Hierarchy 3. Layout 4. Typography 5. Color Theory 6. Process

Each unit had designated projects and with each project, there were several articles that were optional to read. Most of the articles were pretty helpful and were all available for free online.

## The Projects

I'm still pretty new to the world of design. Even though I already knew the difference between UX/UI, how a wireframe is different from a prototype, and how important design is in general, **Designlab** was still made me realize how much more complex design can really be even when your only goal is simplicity.

I explored each project more in depth [on this page](//fvcproductions.com/portfolio/designlab-submissions/), but you're also free to look at it on [my Behance portfolio](//www.behance.net/gallery/29117121/My-Designlab-Experience) as well.

## The Difference

The difference, I believe, between something like [DailyUI](//chadtrutt.com/ "Chad Trutt") challenges and [Designlab](//trydesignlab.com "Designlab") is the amount of feedback you're going to get. I feel the main thing you're paying for is the community and feedback. The articles they provide as mini-lessons before each project are all actually free online somewhere, but, nonetheless, they were **very** well selected.

## The Aftermath

![Designlab - Course Completion](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/designlab-course-summary.png)

Upon course completion, I received a [nice online certificate](//trydesignlab.com/certificates/design-101/fvcproductions/) which I promptly added to my LinkedIn (they made this really easy to do).

The certificate itself is actually nothing more than a showcasing of all the design projects I completed for the course.

> Overall, the course was definitely worth the $274. I would learn with Designlab again!
