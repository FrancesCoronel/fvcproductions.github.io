> Fullstack Foundations is the prework course for [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy').

So.

[Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com 'Fullstack Academy')‘s first ever **[Summer of Code](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/summer-of-code 'Summer of Code')** program, which is described as a program that "_gives college students the opportunity to study full stack web development while on summer break_" is starting this June.

Specifically, Monday, June 8th 2015.

Ergo, I'm actually going to be part of an inaugural class of **something**. That's never happened before, so I'm pretty darn excited.

As excited as _I_ can get anyway, which to some people would not really be perceived as very excited at all. Think **[Maurice Moss](https://theitcrowd.wikia.com/wiki/Maurice_Moss 'Maurice Moss')**.

Basically.

**Anyhow**, I'm starting to realize that when Fullstack says "intensive introductory course", they actually do mean an **intensive introductory course**.

Now I'm a CS major. A senior now too, technically speaking! Yet already Week 1 of bloody **Foundations** has been neither a jog through the park nor a slice of pie (_frankly though, I don't enjoy either of those things anyways_).

Now that may be because my CS curriculum doesn't actually focus on web development, like most, but still - geez.

**I'm not saying it was ridiculously difficult either.** It was just more than I expected - I mean, there was **a lot** to do. A lot to get done. You know, the whole doge thing - _much work, such stress, must caffeine, alot study_ - blah, blah blah.

Mmmmhmmm... indeed...

Now that all sounds bad, but it's only because I'm the kind of person who was hoping to sit around all month and be lazy before having to really work my butt off for a full 11 weeks. Mmm...

Well, regardless, I was able to manage. I'm actually quite content with it all. I feel like I'm learning quite a bit already.

I'm on the border between feeling productive and antsy, because on one hand I know I'm getting crap done, but on the other, I'm worried about how much harder it's all going to get. There's also that _teeny tiny little_ fact I'm already aware of about how everybody gets an assessment their official first week of Fullstack Academy to see if they will still be continuing on.

Hmmm... tensions rising.
