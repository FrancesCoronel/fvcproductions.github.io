description: "In celebration of Hispanic Heritage month, Asana, in partnership with BeVisible, is hosting a Real Talk session with a stellar group of colleagues across tech that explores how our cultural identity impacts our careers. By identifying and discussing the cultural traits that define and impact our experiences through the lens of mindfulness, you'll walk away with new ways to overcome challenges, articulate your purpose, and achieve the clarity and determination to catalyze positive change in your workplace and community. The session is intended to be of particular use for software engineers, web developers, and UX designers."
