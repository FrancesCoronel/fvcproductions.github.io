  > What the author, Danny Bickson, has to say:

  _"I believe that every graduate student should try to do at least two internships in the industry. It is a great experience. Below you can find a list I compiled by aggregating information from some of the companies I am in touch with as a part of our GraphLab project. This list is a academic resource - I am not involved in any of the companies below. I also got some angry comments about some company or another missing - this is a personal list. I will be happy to add more companies providing the are doing some interesting research."_

## Why?

So, why this project?

There aren't many internships that deal with A.I in the first place (and therefore, not many extensive lists either) so I figured this might prove useful to other people as well as myself.
