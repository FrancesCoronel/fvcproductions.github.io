I was awarded the Grow with Google scholarship for the Intermediate Mobile Web Specialist Track.

10K students accepted to this specific track out of over 100K applicants across the US. They offered 25K spots for the Web track and another 25K spots for the Android track so about half of applicants got accepted overall.

The scholarship basically means I get access to the 3-month course called "Offline Web Applications" course with support from Udacity mentors.

Excited since I've been really into PWAs since first hearing about them a year ago and then seeing all those cool ways they're being utilized these days at the Chrome Dev Summit last October.
