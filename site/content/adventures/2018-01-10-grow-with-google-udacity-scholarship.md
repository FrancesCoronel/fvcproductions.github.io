## January 10th, 2018

I was awarded the Grow with Google scholarship for the Intermediate Mobile Web Specialist Track.

10K students accepted to this specific track out of over 100K applicants across the US. They offered 25K spots for the Web track and another 25K spots for the Android track so about half of applicants got accepted overall.

The scholarship basically means I get access to the 3-month course called "Offline Web Applications" course with support from Udacity mentors.

Excited since I've been really into PWAs since first hearing about them a year ago and then seeing all those cool ways they're being utilized these days at the Chrome Dev Summit last October.

## Happy to share that I'm one step closer to becoming Google certified! 🎉

I was just awarded a $1,200 scholarship to pursue the Mobile Web Nanodegree through the Grow with Google Udacity Scholarship program.

Back in mid-October of last year, I applied for the Grow with Google Udacity scholarship.

It offered any US resident the opportunity to advance through three key stages with the ultimate goal in my eyes being the certification from Google and a Nanodegree under your belt (those Nanodegrees are quite popular now!).

### Phase 1 - applying for the scholarship 📝️

According to the first video in Phase 2 coursework, ~100,000 people applied

### Phase 2 - completing relevant coursework and participating in forums/Slack group 🎓

50,000 accepted to 4 different tracks (Android & Web)

I was accepted January 10th of this year and the deadline to finish all the coursework and participate actively was April 11th (last Wednesday).

The coursework covered offline-first, service workers, IndexedDB and core concepts from ES6.

### Phase 3 - completing Nanodegree 🌟️

5,000 awarded scholarship from the 4 different tracks

That's where I am now since I was notified I won the scholarship April 17th!

My track turns to preparing for Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree

This Nanodegree covers concepts like responsiveness, accessibility, ES6, automation and tooling with a project involved throughout that you continuously build on.

### Goal - use knowledge gained from Nanodegree to get certified by Google 💼

As a graduate of the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree, Udacity claims I will be fully prepared to earn the Google Mobile Web Specialist Certification, offered directly by Google.

In other words, since they give me access to the Nanodegree for 6 months, I have until mid-October of this year to finish up the coursework and then however much time I need to prep for the certification exam.

It's basically going full-circle!!

## So here's to Mobile Web! 🎉😊
