For an English 218 project, my team and I decided to create two [GitBooks](//gitbook.com) that would serve as a sort of introduction for both Computer Science & English majors at [Hampton University](//hamptonu.edu).

We decided to separate the two majors into 2 different GitBooks:

1.  [An Intro for CS Majors at HU](//bit.ly/hu-book)
2.  [An Intro for ENG Majors at HU](https://www.gitbook.com/book/fvcproductions/an-intro-for-eng-majors-at-hu)

We'll have to see how it goes but I think it has a lot of potential.

* short link to CS GitBook [bit.ly/hu-book](//bit.ly/hu-book)
* about the GitBooks [bit.ly/about-hu-book](//bit.ly/about-hu-book)
* website for GitBooks [hubook.strikingly.com](//hubook.strikingly.com/)

## Table of Contents

## Tools

* This book is published using the platform [GitBook](//bit.ly/hu-book).
* A one-page website for the book is located at [hubook.strikingly.com](//hubook.strikingly.com/).

## Why this project?

* This book would have been so helpful when I was starting out, so I wanted others who were in my place to at least have a smoother process when it comes to integrating to their new college environment.
