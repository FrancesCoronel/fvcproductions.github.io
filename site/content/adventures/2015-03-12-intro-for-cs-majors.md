## I wrote an introductory book geared towards Computer Science majors at Hampton University which currently has over 5K pageviews using the GitBook platform.

### Why this project?

* This book would have been so helpful when I was starting out, so I wanted others who were in my place to at least have a smoother process when it comes to integrating to their new college environment.
