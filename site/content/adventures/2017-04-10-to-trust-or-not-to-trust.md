**Coding bootcamps** are growing [_more and more popular each year_](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/09/17/as-coding-bootcamps-grow-the-skills-gap-could-shrink). ðŸ“ˆ

Beginning in 2012, coding bootcamps began offering courses in software development and promising graduates new careers in technology. The schools, now backed by hundreds of millions in VC funding, will educate about **30,000 students** in 2016, and rake in just shy of **half a billion** in tuition fees. ðŸ’°

Even the creator of *["Cracking the Coding Interview"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) *has gone ahead and vouched for the *[value of coding bootcamps herself](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-that-whole-coding-bootcamp-thing-is-a-scam-right-6fddf14087d4#.meynkdi7c). *ðŸ“–

**But a key pain point** for a lot of potential students is whether or not theyâ€™ll really be able to get a job right afterward and how **trustworthy** it is.

To combat this, in early 2015, a group of coding schools sent a letter to President Obama, [pledging to release standardized and audited outcome reports](https://thenesta.org/). That never happened. ðŸ˜ž

As of today, [_Flatiron is still one of the very few coding bootcamps_](https://blog.flatironschool.com/announcing-flatiron-schools-2015-jobs-report/) in the world with an independently verified job placement report for all graduates. ðŸ’¼

This app would make that a reality for all coding bootcamps by automatically parsing information from LinkedIn and Glassdoor in order to **predict job placement salary** based off of **publicly available alumni and job salary data**. ðŸŽ‰

The app can also validate alumni reviews by **aggregating them** from across the web where they are posted (Yelp, Quora, Course Report, techendo, etc.) and filtering to include only **unique reviews**. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Ultimately, the goal is to add a layer of trustworthiness to coding bootcamps which as of right now, have *[no standard measurements for job placement rates](https://www.ibtimes.com/code-boot-camps-fail-obama-unaudited-stats-cast-doubt-success-rates-2301188) *with some going as far as _[trying to hide negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h6abk/are_coding_bootcamp_horror_stories_common/)_.ðŸ‘º

The demand for this kind of product is very high and here are two recent articles that speak more on this: _[Could coding boot camps see stricter standards?](https://www.myajc.com/news/technology/could-coding-boot-camps-see-stricter-standards/ns4kQ/) _(Nov 2016) and _[Students are demanding the facts about coding bootcamps](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/students-are-demanding-the-facts-about-coding-bootcamps/)_ (Aug 2016). ðŸ“°
