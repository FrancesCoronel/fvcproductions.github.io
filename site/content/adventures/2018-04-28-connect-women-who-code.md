I was selected to be a speaker at CONNECT 2018, which is an annual conference organized by Women Who Code that brings together speakers from around the world to share their stories and expertise about technology.

This year, the conference was held from 8 am to 5 pm on April 28th at Twitter's HQ in SF.
