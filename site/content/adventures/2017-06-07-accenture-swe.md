## About

The Accenture Liquid Studios are designed for rapid application development. They help companies become built for change through new skills, processes, products and ways of working.

## Role

### Software Engineer

The Liquid Studios are purpose-built to help clients speed up innovation through rapid prototyping & app development to accelerate their next phase of digital transformation.

I was part of the Software Innovation team with my specialty being in UI development & testing.

My clients included a popular health insurance company primarily based in California and one of the biggest mobile communications company in the world.

I was in charge of

- Developing and testing custom components using Angular & TypeScript
- Implementing project-wide documentation
- Spearheading new development, testing and user story management workflows and tools

Outside of client work, I was also involved in the following

- Liquid Studio Silicon Valley On Boarding Lead
- Technology Development Program Rewards & Recognition Action Team Lead
- Chief Editor of the Software Innovation assets for the Liquid Studios
- Volunteer and Participant for the 2017 West Coast Leadership Summit
- 3rd place winner at an Alexa Hackathon hosted by Amazon and Accenture

Through Accenture, I've also had the wonderful opportunity to have many learning opportunities outside of work fully reimbursed. Externally, I've been able to attend Strange Loop and the Chrome Dev Summit. Internally, I've gone through training in Chicago on DevOps and Agile through the Technology Development Program, attended the West Coast Leadership Summit and won an award at the Accenture Alexa hackathon. I've also spoken as a representative from Accenture at the Women Who Code CONNECT 2018 conference hosted at Twitter's HQ in SF.
