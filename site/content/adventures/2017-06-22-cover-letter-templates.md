I created 5 different cover letter templates for 5 different companies: Braintree, IDEO, Meetup, NBCUniversal, and SeatGeek.

I created these while I was in the process of applying for jobs at these places.

The cover letters have been sanitized to remove any meaningful personal information.

These templates are free for anyone to use and modify by [downloading the Pages files from my GitHub](//github.com/fvcproductions/cover-letter-templates).
