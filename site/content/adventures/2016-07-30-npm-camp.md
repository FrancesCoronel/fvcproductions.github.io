## About

A community conference for all things `npm`.

This was an A-mazing conference. Probably one of the most diverse conferences Iâ€™ve attended in tech and thatâ€™s saying quite a bit.

Such a vibrant community and the catering was just absolutely killer. Lemonade and veggie sandwiches - yummy! `#blessed`

I learned a bit about:

* how to publish a module to npm **favorite**
* increasing accessibility using aXe core
* different package managers out there besides npm
* the nodebot community and how important the code of conduct is
* semantic versioning
* Greenkeeper.io
* registry design patterns

### Banners

Here are some banners I made in recognition of the conference.
