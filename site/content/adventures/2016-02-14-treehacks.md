> _Ammalia._ Where surgeons go to explore.

Check out this TreeHack at [`devpost.com/software/ammalia`](https://devpost.com/software/ammalia).

_Ammalia_, which means surgery in Arabic, is a Leap Motion assisted app that allows a surgeon to analyze pictures of their patient's problem (i.e. brain tumors) using the Dropbox API.

* _Use cases?_ - The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in & sterile in the OR.

In their own words and with only slight editing for clarity, hackers will have the chance to explain their backgrounds, tell their stories, and (humble)brag about their coolest hacks What got you into hacking?</p></blockquote>

### Hackathon

[TreeHacks](https://treehacks.com)\ February 12th to 14th, 2016\ Stanford University\ [Devpost for TreeHacks 2016 Submissions](https://treehacks-2016.devpost.com/)

[![Hacked at TreeHacks](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/treehacks.png?w=300)](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/treehacks.png) Hacked at TreeHacks - README badge

### Prizes Won

* _Best Use of Dropbox API_ - 50 GB of Dropbox storage for each member - _Best Social Impact_ - Lunch with Stanford President Hennessey + \$400 to a charity of your choice - Coaching with Shannon Farley & Tour of Fast Forward + \$400 to a charity of your choice

### Branding

* Theme Color: `#62A7C6` - Font: `Karla`

### Future features

1. We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time. 2. Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation. 3. Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase different health record data points that pertain to the patient being showcased\ (i.e. name, age, background, etc).

### Tools

* [Leap Motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) - uses Leap Motion API and hardware to track hand gestures (pan in/out, zoom in/out, slide right/left) without physically touching computer - [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) - use Dropbox for uploading/storing images for patient‚Äôs problems - have folders within Dropbox API represent a single patient
