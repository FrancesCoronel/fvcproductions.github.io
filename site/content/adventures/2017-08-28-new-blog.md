## I know what you're thinking... 💭

What's with the creepy banner image? 👻

Well, here's the thing.

At the beginning of this year, I decided to say goodbye to Wordpress and migrate my blog to something faster and with less restraints (_cough_ static site generators _cough_)

![Buh bye Wordpress!](https://media.giphy.com/media/uLda64US3sb16/giphy.gif)

Something like Jekyll.

## OR SO I THOUGHT.

You see, here's the thing.

## Jekyll is actually REALLY, REALLY slow. 🐢

Like so slow it makes me cringe inside.

Here's an example of what the hell I'm taking about.

It took 87 seconds to serve my shitty website up?? REALLY? 😔

Like that's really intense. I have less than 110 blog posts!!

So yeah, that's where my mind state is these days. 😪

I'm trying my hardest outside of work to get this website sanitized before I migrate **(AGAIN)** to a faster static site generator like [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) which uses `Go` and was able to serve all my posts in like 8 ms.

> Lesson of the Day: Maintaining a website is tedious!
