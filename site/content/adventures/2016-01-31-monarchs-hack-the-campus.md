For an upcoming hackathon at [ODU](//odu.edu) dubbed [`Monarchs Hack the Campus`](//www.cs.odu.edu/~acm/hackathon/), I'm acting as a volunteer and am already helping out with some pretty big tasks.

## Tasks

* branding
  * created 4 new banners using Sketch and existing logo (credits to Michelle Graham for the logo)
* the actual website
  * **completely redesigned** from the bottom up to have a nice look and feel based on an HTML5UP template
* registration
  * redesigned and made some minor changes to the configuration for the Typeform used as registration for those interested in attending the hackathon

## Tools

* [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net)
* [Sublime Text](https://github.com/fvcproductions/Sublime)
* [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
