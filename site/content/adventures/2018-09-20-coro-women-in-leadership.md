Coro Northern California, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, prepares individuals for collaborative leadership so they can effectively tackle pressing, public problems. For 75 years, Coro has developed and delivered experiential learning programs so individuals, communities, and institutions better understand themselves, how to work with others, and how to improve their impact.

Coro's Women in Leadership program supports the leadership development of women across the Bay Area, establishes a pipeline for professional advancement, and creates a cross-sector network of women who support each other's career growth.

## Overview

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women are 47% of the workforce but still earn only 79% of what men earn and make up fewer than 1 in 3 chief executives. Now, more than ever, we need women leaders at the forefront to address pressing professional and civic challenges.

Coro's Women in Leadership program supports the leadership development of women across the Bay Area, establishes a pipeline for professional advancement, and creates a cross-sector network of women who support each other's career growth.
