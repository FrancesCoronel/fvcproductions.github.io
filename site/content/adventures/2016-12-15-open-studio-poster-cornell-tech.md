Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose business challenges to Cornell Tech.

In Product Studio, teams develop and present new products, services, and strategies that respond to those challenges.

Our team responded to **The New York Times (Community)** challenge: _How might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss important local, national, and global issues?_

To address this problem, we created Q&A, a platform that solicits the opinion of readers based off of both the text analysis of an article and their personal reading history.

At the end of the semester, each team was also tasked to create a poster for their community challenge teams in order to display them at Open Studio.
