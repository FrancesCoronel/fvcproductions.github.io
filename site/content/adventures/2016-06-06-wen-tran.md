I had the pleasure to chat with Frances and to receive her guidance on all things related to coding bootcamps and tech careers. She was so generous with her time, and she shared with me the resources and advices that are beneficial to help me prepare for my admission interviews, JavaScript learning tools, and insights on navigating the tech scenes as the beginners. She is the epitome of a "giver"/ caring mentor, and makes the developers' community such a welcoming and inviting place.

Again, my sincere thanks to you and I hope we have the chance to reconnect when you're in NYC!
