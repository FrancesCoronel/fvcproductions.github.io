> There are ~~58~~ 57 days in Fullstack. These are the second 5.

## Day One - Monday

* I have the whole apartment to myself for this week so it's going to a very, very chill environment. JOY.

## Day Two - Tuesday

* I've decided I'm just not a big fan of [Codewars](//codewars.com 'Codewars').
* I just prefer [Code School](//codeschool.com 'Code School')'s cleaner design & fun videos. Oh, well!

## Day Three - Wednesday

* Pair programming worked out great today. I'm building web apps already! 😁

## Day Four - Thursday

* I enjoyed socializing more today.
* I have slightly more respect for Code School after dealing with Treehouse today.
* Team lunch today. We played UNO and Kevin won. I've decided UNO is boring.
* Finally finished a presentation about cool web dev tips & tricks. That took me basically all day.

## Day Five - Friday

* People liked the presentation! Yesssss.... :grin:
* Hot Seat today. I'm really enjoying hearing these stories. If only there was some sort of fireplace...
* Finally gave in and installed `zsh` today using some dude's dot files (he's a big Spacegray theme fan too). Now everything looks and feels **SPACEGRAY**. Heyyyy.
* Bought this [Sublime Text Power User](//sublimetextbook.com/ 'ST3 Power User') book by the Bos for `$25`. I used the coupon code `CHRISTMAS` which still worked and took `$11` off. LOL.
* It sucks that [Flavours](//flavours.interacto.net/ 'Flavours') is no longer going to exist once `El Capitan` comes out. I want to be able to customize EVERYTHING.
