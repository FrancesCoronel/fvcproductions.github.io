## About

The first hackathon I attended.

DC Hack 2014 took place at Google DCâ€™s office and lasted 24 hours, starting at 12:00pm on Saturday, October 25.

With a four-person team, I participated in a Google-sponsored hackathon at their DC headquarters that was just open for two HCBU's - Hampton and Howard.

Our team used the Google App Engine to create a very simple web app where users could add markers onto a map.
