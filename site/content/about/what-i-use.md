## Hardware

### Peripherals

I won a pair of [Bose headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones.html) at the TAPIA conference from a Dropbox raffle so I use those basically all the time.

### Phone

I decided to switch from an iPhone 6 to a [Google Pixel 2](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_2) recently. So far, I'm very very satisfied with the transition.
