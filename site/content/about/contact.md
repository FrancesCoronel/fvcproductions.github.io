## Ask Me Anything 🤔️

Just have a general question? Maybe you found a typo?

Feel free to [submit a new issue](//github.com/fvcproductions/ama) through my AMA GitHub repo.

## LinkedIn 💼️

If you'd like to stay in touch professionally, don't hesistate to [connect with me on LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions).

## Calendly 📅

If you'd like to set up a phone or video chat, you can use my [Calendly](//calendly.com/fvcproductions) to book a time with me.

### Mentoring 💛️

Because of high demand, as of February 2018, I will be charging $30 per hour for mentoring since I am already working part-time as a [Thinkful mentor](//www.thinkful.com/mentors/) and also have a full-time job.

So before booking a mentoring session through Calendly, please make sure to [Cash](//cash.me/$fvcprdxs) or [Venmo](//venmo.com/fvcproductions) me the appropriate amount.
