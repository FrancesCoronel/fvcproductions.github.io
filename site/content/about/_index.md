<h2>I like to dabble with things that <del>shouldn’t</del> ought to be dabbled with.</h2>

My "life motto", if you will.

Might have something to do with human nature in general, though, so interpret it as you will.

<p class="notice"><b>Fun Fact</b> My logo is a chocolate dipped strawberry. No particular
reason why, I just think they're yummy. 🍓🍫</p>
