      AAAI is pleased to announce the continuation of its Student Scholarship
      Program for 2016, which is sponsored by the AI Journal. The Student
      Scholar Program provides partial travel support for students who are
      full-time undergraduate or graduate students at colleges and universities;
      are members of AAAI; submit papers to the conference program or letters of
      recommendation from their faculty advisor; and submit scholarship
      applications to AAAI by November 30, 2015. In addition, repeat scholarship
      applicants must have fulfilled the volunteer and reporting requirements
      for previous awards. In the event that scholarship applications exceed
      available funds, preference will be given to students who have an accepted
      technical paper, and then to students who are actively participating in
      the conference in some way. However, all eligible students are encouraged
      to apply. After the conference, an expense report will be required to
      account for the funds awarded.

      The Student Volunteer Program is an essential part of the conference and
      student participation is a valuable contribution. Volunteers will support
      AAAI organizers in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2016, a limited number of
      complimentary technical program registrations will be available for
      students who volunteer during the conference. Preference will be given to
      participating students for the volunteer positions. Local students or
      students not requiring travel assistance can apply for the Volunteer
      Program if openings are available. AAAI membership is required for
      eligibility. The deadline for volunteer applications is November 30, 2015.
