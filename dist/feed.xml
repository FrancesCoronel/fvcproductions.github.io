      <description>So I first decided that blogging would be a fun thing to do in my spare time back in the summer of 2013.
I had just graduated high school and I was terribly excited to get away from the very familiar scene that was my hometown of Norfolk, VA. While my peers would flaunt their out of state colleges that they‚Äôd be attending, I was on my way out of the country.</description>

Well, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing.
At the beginning of this year, I decided to say goodbye to Wordpress and migrate my blog to something faster and with less restraints (cough static site generators cough)
Something like Jekyll.
OR SO I THOUGHT. You see, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing.
Jekyll is actually REALLY, REALLY slow. üê¢ Like so slow it makes me cringe inside.</description>

Point of View Summary we met&amp;hellip; potential college students who are overwhelmed with the possibilities of their future
we were amazed to realize&amp;hellip; how little transparency there is into different educational or career paths
it would be game changing if we&amp;hellip; could provide a way for students to look into the future and make more educated decisions about what their next steps should be</description>

      <guid>/2017/02/06/view-linkedin-profiles-without-logging-in-/</guid>
      <description>The Problem You want to view someone on LinkedIn but you don&amp;rsquo;t have a profile and have no desire to create an account.
Or you want to view a profile but without the person knowing and you&amp;rsquo;re definitely not willing to spend all that cash on the premium upgrade which would allow you to do that (it&amp;rsquo;s 25+ bucks/month!!!). üí∏ üí∏ üí∏
Either way, LinkedIn wants you to sign in and will have an annoying popup that looks like this The Solution Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of this of this annoying popup and continue browsing profiles with 3 simple steps.</description>

This app was done for an engineering internship screening for DoSomething.org.
The source code can be found at https://github.com/fvcproductions/ds-todos.
The full process for setting up Laravel 5.3 is pretty tedious so I created my own tutorial as well!

One day, I accidentally went into one of Fullstack Academy‚Äòs classes, other students had no idea with some of the things that Frances showed me. It definitely gave me a head start in my career in web development and helped me pick up things more efficiently throughout the process.</description>

      <description>Check out the crowd-sourced map at
mapme.com/coding-bootcamps =================================================================
The world is teeming with coding bootcamps, but I just couldn‚Äôt find a more geographically/visually oriented website that showed all the physical coding bootcamps that are available out there.
In comes Coding Bootcamps, a crowd-sourced map that provides links to in-person coding bootcamps/development schools located worldwide using the service MapMe.
 I began working on this project in November 2014 and provided a big update on January 12, 2016.</description>

      <description>Overview  Meetup Dice - Winner
Check out the web app at meetfvc.herokuapp.com. So for my Norfolk.js Meetup group, they like to give out prizes through a raffle every Meetup. The method they used was messy with a simple console application (I think). Anyway, I just wanted a better visual experience for choosing a random person to give a prize to.
Right now, unfortunately, this web app just works for the Meetup groups I‚Äôm a part of but eventually, I‚Äôd like to be able to use the Meetup API to get it to work for anybody‚Äôs Meetup profile.</description>

      <description>I want to thank Frances Coronel and Josh for their leadership and guidance beginning my class in the Hour of Code. I was timid in that I have very little knowledge and did not want to turn my students off to this concept by confusing them. They did quite the opposite! The students have been excited and yearning for more! Thank you for your help and keep making a difference!</description>

 Attend more conferences. Attend more hackathons. Graduate.
 Attend more conferences.  It&amp;rsquo;s always hard trying to find out which conferences I can really afford to go to time or money-wise, but I realize every time I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to one, they&amp;rsquo;ve been just ridiculously helpful in terms of personal growth.</description>

      <description>I signed my Sedgefield Elementary School classes up for &amp;ldquo;The Hour of Code&amp;rdquo; this past December 2015. Ms. Coronel was one of the volunteers I could choose to invite to do a presentation to my 3rd-grade students. She eagerly accepted my invite and planned with me what Newport News Public Schools wants our students to learn, our Citizen, College, and Career ready ideals and connected them to her unique presentation presented from the aspect of a female Latina.</description>

To say the kids were excited is an understatement, they were &amp;ldquo;electrified!&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Frances prepared an excellent presentation when she volunteered in my classes on December 7th, 2015 during the Hour of Code Activity. She was professional and her presentation was instructional and entertaining. She provided students with valuable information about the Computer Science field of study and job market. She also provided assistance¬†to students who needed help with the Hour of Code activities.
I am very grateful to have had Frances as a presenter and her assistance during the Hour of Code in my classes.</description>

Quite a few schools reached out to me, but, of course, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t volunteer with some of them due to constraints in my class schedule or because they were just too far away.</description>

      <description>Dear Holberton,  This challenge is my personal essay, where I tell you why I want to become a software engineer and why I want to attend Holberton School.
 Why do I want to become a software engineer? When I was in elementary school, my goal was to become a vet. I was 10, I had just gotten my first dog, Nefer, and I was just hooked. Before this period, I had never considered a formal career choice.</description>

      <description>So I live in Norfolk, Virginia which is this beautiful small town by the sea. Norfolk is part of the Hampton Roads area which is often referred to as the 757 since that&amp;rsquo;s our catchy area code.
Norfolk has a growing developer community, but it has yet to really establish a culture for them. This is where conferences usually come in.
Having said that, HR DevFest, the first major tech conference catering to the 757 area, was actually today on November 14th, 2015 from 8:30 am to 6 pm.</description>

      <description>Because of how busy I&amp;rsquo;ve been, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been able to get into the proper mood to be able to blog about such and such.
As a result, there are now only 7 days of Fullstack left.
 Yup, just 7 MORE DAYS.
 WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTT. SERIOUSLY?? AND here&amp;rsquo;s a GIF on how I feel about my lack of blogging so far here in my senior phase. My Junior Phase Date Range Day Numbers Week</description>

      <description>Overview I developed a web app (still in BETA) that ranks coding bootcamps based on social and rating score based on data crawled from various sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, Course Report, Facebook, AngelList, Google+, etc.) using Cheerio and the MEAN stack.
 This project was completed on August 11th, 2015 for the Stackathon phase of Fullstack Academy.

      <description>Overview I collaborated in a four-person team to create an e-commerce store that specializes in selling robots with features such as multi-tenancy, admin/merchant dashboards, and social login using the MEAN stack, the Mandrill API, and OAuth.
 This project was completed on August 5th, 2015 for the Stackstore phase of Fullstack Academy.

      <description>On June 18th, the 2nd Thursday of Fullstack Academy, I realized a lot of my partners for pair programming would ask me similar questions regarding my dev environment so I started making a deck of some tips and tricks that I felt would have proven valuable for me back in the day. //speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/awesome-web-dev-tips-and-tricks
Then today, I was part of the first group that had to present a Tech Talk, a 10 minute talk every student has to give on a tech topic at some point during the senior phase of Fullstack.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s also review week, which is from July 20th to July 24. Review week doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as Fullstack Academy. ;)
‚ù§Ô∏è
 Day One - Monday  This is my last week as a junior. I guess I could go all cliche here and say that time flew by, but eh, to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve time traveled in a pretty normal way, which does surprise me.</description>

 Day One - Monday  Creating the live UI for Trip Planner is good since I like my partner. We get stuck a lot, but he&amp;rsquo;s super resilient. He even made a really cool theme for his that reminded me a lot of Tron Legacy (the 1980&amp;rsquo;s version, not the recent one).</description>

 Day One - Monday  Much progress was made with Promises - I still need to review some more though. We also started creating our own Bootstrap template with SASS. This has been really difficult, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve only just now been introduced to the more technical CSS side of design.</description>

Looking forward to more promises being made. Hehe. üòã  Day Two - Tuesday  The twitter-js project was fun, but this twitter-sql business is just a whole nother ballgame, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I really like playing‚Ä¶ ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è On the other hand, Mongo seems nice.</description>

 Day One - Monday  I have the whole apartment to myself for this week so it&amp;rsquo;s going to a very, very chill environment. JOY.  Day Two - Tuesday  I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m just not a big fan of Codewars. I just prefer Code School&amp;rsquo;s cleaner design &amp;amp; fun videos. Oh, well!</description>

Day One - Monday  Orientation &amp;amp; icebreakers today. I come to realize I&amp;rsquo;m actually very used to icebreakers after going through many different programs. Learning names comes easy. My first impression is that many people here are nice and somewhat soft-spoken. My second impression is a bit of surprise and respect for those who came from far, far away, like New Zealand &amp;amp; France.</description>

Again, you can find the Google Map at bit.ly/bootcampme. As of right now, there are exactly 165 distinct bootcamps on the map, which is pretty awesome. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s only been 3 years and there&amp;rsquo;s already so many!</description>

Listen!
The startups will still be looking here, to us, to the Fullstack developers to lead.
And what will they see?
Frightened cowboy coders typing away on an Acer?
No.
No, they will see true programmers! And Macs!
And what the enemy will see is the agility of our source code.
They will hear the ring of our GitHub clients, and they will know what we can do!</description>

      <description>Back in December of last year, I was browsing through Kickstarter - eager to spend my limited college student cash on something awesome. I found Hollow Knight. So I ended up coming across a project called Hollow Knight. I decided I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to commit and told Kickstarter to Remind Me later to see if I still wanted to back up. The video was beyond amazing, but I was just a little unsure if my 2nd investment on Kickstarter should be in a 2D game.</description>

For Auschwitz served not just as a &amp;ldquo;terribly&amp;rdquo; pleasant read, but also as a brilliant commentary on the affairs of the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp through the eyes of a survivor. The eyes of one who lived through eight months as a Sonderkommando, who were those &amp;ldquo;privileged&amp;rdquo; prisoners selected as prominent work units for the Nazi death camps and were guaranteed at least four months of life before being dispensed of and replaced, given that all Sonderkommandos had access to the deepest, darkest secrets of the concentration camps.</description>

And by MacBook Air, I really just mean the OS X system but the hardware is okay too.
 So here are 3 of my favorite power tools that changed how I worked and my average level of productivity on a daily basis.
There are other awesome power apps of course, like
 Amphetamine Bartender Dash Flux Sorty Ubersicht Yoink  among others - but these 3 are by far my favorite.</description>

Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to compile all the music from my iTunes library due to sheer boredom. Also, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to see how much my musical preferences have changed a few years from now. And it will change.
As a general rule with my albums, if an artist has less than 5 songs in my library, all the songs from that artist are put into a &amp;ldquo;Random&amp;rdquo; album, which means they&amp;rsquo;re bunched up with a whole lot of other songs that fall into a particular genre.</description>

You can always use bookmarks, but if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you know too many bookmarks tend to suck and end up just being a useless clutter of links you never end up actually benefitting from.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll be acting as a volunteer for the conference (it&amp;rsquo;s the first winter conference, too, apparently) and was therefore lucky enough to get a \$200 scholarship and a complimentary registration (\$450, in my case) to attend.
\$200 is very little to cover travel and hotel costs, but seeing as I have no serious research experience in the field yet, I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;m still fine with it.</description>

Well, given that it&amp;rsquo;ll be roughly 20 weeks before I enroll in whatever bootcamp I decide to attend, I&amp;rsquo;m dubbing this post ‚ÄòWeek ‚Äì20: As in 20 Weeks Prior&amp;rsquo;.
Now that we&amp;rsquo;re past clarifications, here&amp;rsquo;s the low down:  I wanted to start building stuff for a while now, specifically since early May of last year, the month I first started hearing about bootcamps when my dad showed me this Huffington Post article featuring Dev Bootcamp.</description>

For privacy, I&amp;rsquo;ve replaced her name with the word &amp;ldquo;buddy&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>The Coding Bootcamp Ultimatum
Okay, so on my search for the perfect coding bootcamp (I&amp;rsquo;m just going to refer to it as CB) last year and now again this year, I used/am using several different websites.
So today we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at each of these compare/finder websites for CBs by analyzing the prominent Hack Reactor bootcamp on each website.
For each of these sites, I&amp;rsquo;ll be annotating the design interface directly with my personal critiques (if I have any to give) just because there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement, and you know, why not?</description>

Since then, it went on to accommodate practically every other major game platform besides the very much new Xbox 1. I myself first became familiar with the title back in 2012, a few months after it was released to the App store on Macs. It already had a decent number of reviews. I could tell it was going to be something big, because all the reviews were pretty much 5 stars (ya DERP).</description>

 Google+ (the Facebook wanna-be) Behance (where creativity can be unleashed) LinkedIn (making business people look good) Wordpress (professional looking posts) Quora (questions and answers) Tumblr (diverse posts) SoundCloud (music) Vimeo (high quality videos) Scribd (documents/books) YouTube (the best and worst videos) Twitter (tweet, tweet) Quizlet (quizzes all abound) a Facebook Account (casual stalking) a Facebook Page (organization stalking)  there&amp;rsquo;s a lot one can&amp;rsquo;t not do.</description>

Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing past and current examples of technological dependence in the economy. To get a better sense of this age old fear of technology replacing humans, we also have to go back in time. So in essence I will be looking at past and current examples of robotics shifting the workforce and how they will influence future circumstances.</description>

      <description>What makes you feel better when you are in a bad mood?
A good movie,
the art of digital hieroglyphics,
a tall glass of skim milk,
or a quick book read.
All in all, a
good,
digital,
skim,
book.</description>

      <description>So if you&amp;rsquo;re not already familiar with Robert Green&amp;rsquo;s popular book &amp;ldquo;The 48 Laws of Power&amp;rdquo; that was published in 1998, I&amp;rsquo;m going to suggest you read it‚Ä¶ right now.
Like any popular book, it has its positive and negative criticisms, but I found it immensely interesting for a self-help book.
I felt some of the laws mentioned had some real merit so I decided to go ahead and share some of them to let you decide yourself.</description>

      <description>So this past winter, I applied to Bitmaker Labs for their summer 2014 full-time web development immersive course and was luckily accepted.
Bitmaker Labs is a coding boot camp located in Toronto, Canada that focuses on making curious people great web developers within 9 weeks.
Unfortunately, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to attend given that I have mandatory school courses I have to take, but for anyone looking to learn more about coding, specifically within web development, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend this one.</description>

      <description>Welcome, welcome! Moving from Python, we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at Java - AWW YEA!
Now Java is by far one of the most important languages a CS major or really anyone involved in the software industry is sort of expected to understand (at least a bit!).
Python and Ruby, while they are quite exquisite in their own right, with their easy to understand English-like syntax, nothing really beats the big &amp;ldquo;Daddies&amp;rdquo; CS majors recognize as C and Java.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s up to you, I&amp;rsquo;m not the pushy type.
So long time, no see, and naturally it&amp;rsquo;s time for another programming session, BUT this time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be working with Python!

      <description>This was a more research-oriented piece for my history class, but I hope you enjoy it - it was honestly a really eye-opening book and I&amp;rsquo;m just grateful to have read it.
[Written February 21, 2014]
Barbara Demick, Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (New York: Spiegel &amp;amp; Grau, 2009).
In the epilogue, the author points out that North Korea is a bit of mystery. After all, here is a country that has been able to, under rule of one of the last remaining family dictatorships, avoid an economic collapse that experts have been predicting for at least 15 years.</description>

I figured I would switch things up a bit since I published a long list of insults and so I&amp;rsquo;m going to go ahead and post some of my favorite pick up lines.
They&amp;rsquo;re more for amusement&amp;rsquo;s sake than anything else.
And while it may be hard to insult someone, it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to make &amp;lsquo;em swoon.
Most of these are cheesy, but hey maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just cheesy for you (see what I did there?</description>

      <description>How are students selected? There are 2 main ideas behind selection. 1. You have a basic working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.
 They judge you on how you think, not what you know  How willing are you to learn? What is your potential to succeed? Can you demonstrate the aptitude to pick up simple concepts? Have you learned a reasonable amount of JavaScript on your own?  Their ability to teach you is very important  You should not be afraid to ask questions (be honest about your weaknesses).</description>

This essay talks about social networking in the classroom basically.
Unfortunately, even though I had tried again to get accepted, I was unable to attend the summer program.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the moral of the story &amp;ndash; write shorter essays to actually get accepted into summer gov school and then once accepted, actually fit time into schedule to be able to attend.</description>

This essay was one of my favorite ones to write because at the time (when I was in 9th grade), I felt I could relate a lot to Christopher from the novel, &amp;ldquo;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&amp;rdquo;. I was assigned to write a sort of creative essay from the POV of Christopher (the protagonist who is a 15 year old boy in the novel with an autistic spectrum condition &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing Asperger&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

      <description>Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools. So far, I‚Äôve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like Fullstack Academy, Hack Reactor, and MakerSquare.
I‚Äôve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field.</description>

      <description>TravelsWhere I&#39;ve been. https://fvcproductions.com/about/travels ¬© FVCproductions
 So I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I come from a pretty interesting background.  Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶
 North America  I was born into a 100% Peruvian family in Newport News, VA and raised in Norfolk, VA.  I was exposed to a lot of different cultures very early on given that Norfolk is one of the largest naval bases in the US and families from all over the place come to stay for a few years or longer.</description>
