## The Problem

You want to view someone on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions) but you don't have a profile and have no desire to create an account.

*Or* you want to view a profile but without the person knowing and you're definitely not willing to spend all that cash on the premium upgrade which would allow you to do that (it's 25+ bucks/month!!!).¬†üí∏ üí∏¬†üí∏

## Either way,¬†LinkedIn wants you to sign in and will have an annoying popup that looks like this

## The Solution

Let's get rid of this of this annoying popup and continue browsing profiles with 3 simple steps.

> To Note. You will need to use Chrome.

### Step 1. [Download StyleBot¬†as a Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en)

### Step 2.¬†[Install Style in Stylebot](https://stylebot.me/styles/15975)

I created this style using Stylebot that will allow us to avoid looking
at ads and the popups when viewing a LinkedIn profile.
