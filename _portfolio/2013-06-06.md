<p class="intro">Essentially, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/pursuit-of-knowledge/id1073378182?ls=1&amp;mt=11" target="_blank"><i>Pursuit of Knowledge</i></a> explores various mediums where the plot and theme relation are similar in that they each explore how humans are consistently aiming to create a creature more powerful than themselves and the consequences that can be faced from that decision.</p>
<p>This iBook was created for an AP Literature end of the year project in June 2013.</p>
<p>It was written in dedication to the AP Literature professor, Mrs. Cook, who allowed me to explore my ideas in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mrs.Cook.</p>
