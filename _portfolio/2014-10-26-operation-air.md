With a four-person team, I participated in a Google-sponsored hackathon
at their DC headquarters that was just open for two HCBU's - Hampton and
Howard.

The hackathon took place on October 25th, 2014.

Our team use Google App Engine to create a very simple web app where
users could add markers onto a map.
