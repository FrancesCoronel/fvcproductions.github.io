<ul>
<li><strong>About</strong>
<ul>
<li>This degree is designed to provide MSCS students with a broad business education, which will increase their value to the firms where they will apply their information technology skills.</li>
<li>The combined degree will position these students to assume leadership roles in these firms.</li>
<li>In the combined degree, students will gain not only technical knowledge provided in the MSCS program but the ability to put that technical knowledge to use in business applications.</li>
<li>Graduates of the combined program will be highly sought after by businesses.</li>
<li>The vast majority of the graduates of MSCS already pursue careers in business, and with an MBA, they will be even more valuable to these businesses.</li>
<li>This combined program has identified courses with subject matter that is essential to both degree programs.</li>
<li>As a result, we are giving graduates of this combined degree a broader education than students would obtain by taking only one of these programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Required to Apply</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students qualifying for the MS Computer Science/MBA joint degree will be allowed to enter the program directly following their bachelors degree without having previously obtained a masters degree.</li>
<li>Under other circumstances, the College of Business usually requires students to have an advanced degree or 5 years of business experience to enter their 48 credit MBA program.</li>
<li>Admission decisions for the combined degree program will be made separately by each program’s admissions committee.</li>
<li>An applicant may originate the application in either department or may already be admitted to one or the other program.</li>
<li>The candidate would have to be approved by both admissions committees to gain admission to the combined program.</li>
