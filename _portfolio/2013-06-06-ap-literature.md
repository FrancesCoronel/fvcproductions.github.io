Essentially, [*Pursuit of Knowledge*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/pursuit-of-knowledge/id1073378182?ls=1&mt=11) explores various mediums where the plot and theme relation are similar in that they each explore how humans are consistently aiming to create a creature more powerful than themselves and the consequences that can be faced from that decision.

This iBook was created for an AP Literature end of the year project in June 2013.

It was written in dedication to the AP Literature professor, Mrs. Cook, who allowed me to explore my ideas in every way imaginable.

Thank you, Mrs.Cook.
