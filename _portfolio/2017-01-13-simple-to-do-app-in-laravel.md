Created a simple to-do app in Laravel 5.3 using Homestead.

This app was done for an engineering internship screening for
[DoSomething.org](http://DoSomething.org).

The source code can be found
at <https://github.com/fvcproductions/ds-todos>.

The full process for setting up Laravel 5.3 is pretty tedious so I
created [my own
tutorial](http://fvcproductions.com/2017/01/13/launch-todo-app-laravel/)
as well!
