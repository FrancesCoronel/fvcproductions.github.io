About the Project
-----------------

-   Self-initiated
-   This map provides links to educational institutions that offer
    advanced degrees/concentration/depth/breadth area in artificial
    intelligence (AI) or operate well established AI
    laboratories/research groups.
-   This map is separated into categories by graduate, undergraduate,
    and research groups/labs/institutions.
-   This map also focuses on research efforts related to automated
    reasoning, knowledge representation, agent systems,
    cognitive/computational neuroscience, machine learning, AI-related
    topics, etc.
-   This map *does not* directly focus on research efforts related to
    Robotics or engineering in general.Anyone provided with the link is
    welcome to go ahead and edit the map and contribute more
    universities or research efforts.

You can find this work in progress
[here](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zIblKEWM9BnY.kacxPZLKVHyE "AI International Map") or

Tools
-----

-   This map uses the information provided by [AI
    International](http://www.aiinternational.org/universities.html), a
    site designed to help locate and share international AI research
    efforts.
-   The map is created visually using [Google Maps Engine
    Lite](https://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/products/mapsengine.html).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why?
----

-   To be frank, I just couldn’t find a more geographically/visually
    oriented website that showed which schools specialized in AI
    research.
-   The most extensive information I could find was at the AI
    International website (which is great, but not very visual) with a
    grand list of universities across the world that did.
-   So I’m just converting and expanding the list to include a nice
    visual map with Google Maps Engine.
