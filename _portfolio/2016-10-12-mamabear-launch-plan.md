Splash is an all-in-one Event Marketing Platform built for achieving
goals and tracking impact.

Splash‚Äôs current wedge is a beautiful user interface and seamless user
experience for all their event customers.

Their main competitors such as Eventbrite, Meetup, and Facebook all
serve mainly as high-end bulletin boards to showcase events and
register.

The product we are releasing, appropriately named Mama Bear, allows
Splash to gain a competitive advantage by offering everything our
competitors **as well** as an effective way of managing the event in
real time and keeping all event attendees happy.

This will allow Splash to acquire more users by providing them an
all-inclusive seamless event organization system, thereby increasing
their revenue as well.

**I helped create visual assets, design the presentation, formatted
launch plan, and completed process diagram section of launch plan.**
