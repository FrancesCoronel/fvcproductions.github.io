**You just made my day!** {#you-just-made-my-day style="text-align:center;"}
=========================

As I eventually come across your generous donation, I canâ€™t tell you how
much I appreciate your support for the work I've done across many
mediums, whether it be through development, designs, writing, or
anything else - I appreciate it a lot!

So once again, thank you for your donation.

Here's a virtual hug. It's not much, but it *is* a really cute `GIF`.
