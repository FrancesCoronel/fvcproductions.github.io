My blog and portfolio all in one.

> View my website at [`fvcproductions.github.io`](https://fvcproductions.github.io).

This website is a migration from my old Wordpress website at [`fvcproductions.wordpress.com`](https://fvcproductions.wordpress.com).

It was built from the bottom up.

## Installation

You need to have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed before running the following commands.

```bash
# install necessary dependencies

npm install

# start server

npm start
```

The site will be be displayed at `localhost:3000` with BrowserSync automatically reloading the page with any new changes.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

```bash
# build static version in `/dist` folder

npm run build

# preview draft posts

```

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

Demo images\* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images you can use for pretty much whatever.
