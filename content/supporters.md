## Overview

Hiya there! 👋🏽

My name is Frances and I'm currently Co-Director of [Techqueria](https://techqueria.org), a 501c3 nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx in Tech and also supports [various open-source projects](https://github.com/techqueria). 🌮

While Techqueria encompasses most of my time nowadays, other projects I maintain include:

- [ApprenticeshipsMe](https://github.com/fvcproductions/apprenticeships.me) - A directory of developer and design apprenticeships 🌱
- [DiversifyMe](https://github.com/fvcproductions/diversify-me) - Tech conferences that provide travel grants or scholarships 📍
- [HireMe](https://github.com/fvcproductions/hire-me) - A path to getting an awesome tech gig 💼
- [Tech Queens](https://techqueenspod.com) - The first podcast to focus on the stories and advice shared by women of color in tech 🎙

I am also a passionate speaker on the intersection of Latinidad and technology and have [spoken over 50 times](https://fvcproductions.com/speaking) on both technical and non-technical topics such as being a Latina in tech, breaking into tech, Progressive Web Apps, TypeScript and Web Design. 💬

Creating content that is shared publicly has always been my de facto way of doing things and while I love being able to share all these contributions, I’m only able to do so in my spare time outside of work. ⌛

By becoming a sponsor, you will support my ongoing contributions and allow me to dedicate more time to contribute to the web in new and meaningful ways. 🌐

Thank you! 💛
