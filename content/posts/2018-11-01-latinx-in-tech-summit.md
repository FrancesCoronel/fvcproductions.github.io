The Kapor Center in Oakland organized the Latinx in Tech summit. Nearly 300 people showed up from around the country to meet fellow web designers, investors and entrepreneurs.</p></blockquote>

Our #intersectional identity is complex and beautiful. We are not defined by one thing - gender, race, class and heritage. That is what makes us great. #LTX2018 #latinxintech</p></blockquote>
