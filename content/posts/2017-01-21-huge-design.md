There were 2 parts to the interview process - the video and the design challenge.

## Application Video

For their Experience Design School every summer, HUGE asks applicants to submit a one minute video showing off why they want to attend in a creative way.

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo8WQR-B89I">Huge School Application 2017</a></h4><p>This is my application for the Huge Experience Design School 2017. FVCproductions 2017. No copyright intended. ... Hey HUGE. My name is Frances Virginia Coronel. Coincidentally, I was in fact born in Virginia. For the past 5 years, I've been focused on becoming a better software developer.</p></blockquote>

## Design Challenge

I was tasked with re-designing the website for TSP....

### Redesigned Logos

As part of a redesign assignment for the Huge Experience School program, I redesigned two logos for the TSP website - one horizontal and the other vertical.

### Redesigned Website

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://fvcproductions.github.io/tsp-gov/">Thrift Savings Plan | Home</a></h4><p>This site is also protected by an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate that's been signed by the U.S. government. The https:// means all transmitted data is encrypted - in other words, any information or browsing history that you provide is transmitted securely.</p></blockquote>

## Video Interview

After those two steps, the next step was a video interview with two employees from HUGE. This is the only part that didn't go well apparently. Lol.

## Lessons Learned

On March 23rd, HUGE rejected me but let me know I was a super strong candidate and yadda yadda.

I think HUGE required a lot of time and effort from their applicants. Also, I felt that because I asked a somewhat controversial question during the interview (is it true that HUGE employees can be very cliquish?), I was flagged as not compatible for their culture.
