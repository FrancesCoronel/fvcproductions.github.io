Dear Frances,

On behalf of Mindot, I would like to thank you for the visit and panel you had for Mindot's students. The girls could not stop talking about your amazing work at Slack! It was an incredible experience for them.

We truly appreciate your time and assistance and we hope you enjoyed meeting the students. To us, giving back our time and energy to impacting students and disrupt education is our number one priority.

Please find attached some pictures from the visit in case you would like them for any internal newsletter and/or usage for your LinkedIn profile highlighting your give back!

Regards,
