#### Inspiration

Jake the Dog has a key hand.

#### What it does

Web app that uses LeapMotion to authenticate user trying to enter their home.

#### How we built it

Using CodeKit, we hosted a website and plugged in a lot of Leap Motion plugins along with the API.

#### Challenges we ran into

Getting the Leap Motion hands to display properly was hard. We spent a lot of time working on features that we shouldn't have.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting it to work in only a few hours!

#### What we learned

Different Leap Motion plugins.

#### What's next for Jake the Dog Key Hand | Security Corp

Optimizing the UI, extending password combination capabilities (multiple numbers).

#### Installation

- Use `CodeKit` to minify `CSS` and `JS` files
- Make sure to have LeapMotion installed on your computer
