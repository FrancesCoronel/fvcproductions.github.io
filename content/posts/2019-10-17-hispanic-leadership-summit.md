Hispanic Leadership Summit: San Francisco

Venue: Salesforce Tower

Date / Time: October 17, 2019; 12:00 PM - 6:00 PM

The Hispanic Leadership Summit: San Francisco will convene regional experts and influencers mainly from tech and business at the end of Hispanic Heritage Month to discuss the role of the tech industry to advance Hispanics as customers, employees and citizens.

The Summit aims to gather decision makers from the tech industry and their ecosystems including supply chain, HR and marketing that need to understand the market opportunity and trends, and secondly Hispanic leaders - either champions within corporations as part of ERGs or senior Hispanic talent or leading Hispanic organizations across the country that want to create collective action to generate change.

The Summit will be hosted at the Salesforce Tower on October 17th for a half day of thematic panels, key-note speakers and breakout sessions that will aim to find focus on our shared agenda and areas that unify the Hispanic community to act as one.

During the programming, we will announce the new signatories of the Hispanic Promise since the launch of the Hispanic Heritage Month Challenge, announced at the Hispanic Leadership Summit: Dallas.

Registration opens at 11:00 AM. Lunch will be provided between 11:00-12:00PM. Reception to follow the Summit.
