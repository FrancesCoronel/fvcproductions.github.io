## Mini Takeaways

### **#AppAdvice**: What is a useful app or platform that has helped you grow in your career?

Joining LinkedIn is huge because you gotta network with people!

FreeCodeCamp, Learn Python The Hard Way

### **#LearnThatTerm**: What does the term `mansplaining` mean to you?

Any time that I'm kinda talked over or feels the need to break down the term that I should clearly know, I consider that mansplaining. I think men should be more cognizant that women around them are just as knowledgable.

### **#Friendlies**: What is an organization or affinity group that you would recommend joining?

We have a Ladies circle at Make School - a group of women talking about life or what we're up to.

### **#GrowYourNetwork**: Where do you live online or how can people reach out to you?
