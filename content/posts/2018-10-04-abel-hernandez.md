## Testimonial

Product Manager, UX Researcher & Scrum Master seeking to lead startup teams in user-centric design & agile development.

October 28, 2018

Despite having a busy schedule working for Slack and ongoing open source projects, Frances made time to help me with my Product Manager resume and her contributions to the tech community are incredibly insightful. I keep up with her post because she offers many career & technical resources. She's professional and selfless when it comes to helping and mentoring others. It was through her generosity that I got to attend a Mixpanel Product Growth event. Thank you, Frances!
