Meet Frances Coronel of Slack, a software engineer specializing in user interface (UI) development on the Customer Acquisition Team - her mission is to make your working life simpler, more pleasant and more productive. She is also the Co-Director of Techqueria, a nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx in tech in the U.S., where she works with a team to provide Latinx professionals with the resources and support they need to attain, thrive, and remain in a career within the technology industry. As of last month, Techqueria had 4,000+ members in their Slack Workspace, somewhat of a reflection of the work and volunteering Frances manages to balance, among her other passions: open-source, public speaking and mentoring other people of color in tech. You can find Techqueria on virtually any platform, including podcasts, and you can follow Frances @fvcproductions.
