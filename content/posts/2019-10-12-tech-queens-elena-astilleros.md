## Discussion Points

- Why the Latinx, people of color voice is so critical to thought leadership.
- Latinx/people of color need to embrace trauma work for themselves as part of their career development. " "I’m a big fan of your work! Here’s a little more expansion on the topics above.
- Models of organization, theories, all face blind spots when people of color aren’t at the table.
  - Right now most theory is being pioneered by cis white males, so it’s no surprise that when you look around, you see hierarchical models littered throughout the organizational theory. There are so many concepts that these men just can’t get, because their world view blind sides them.
- We’ve grown up being the unwanted ones, immigrants and their children have grown up among the conversation, “we don’t want you here!” People of color often having to prove their innocence, and feel the onslaught of criticism their whole lives. We may have adapted, but our nervous system doesn’t forget - and when we bring this trauma to the workplace, we might even sabotage ourselves, just to handle the discomfort the trauma brings. " "white men - latina woman making 56% of what they make
- perspectives on how we're raised
- comparing ourselves to others
