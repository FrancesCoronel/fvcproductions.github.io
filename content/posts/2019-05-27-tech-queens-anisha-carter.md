## Mini Takeaways

### **#AppAdvice**: What is a useful app or platform that has helped you grow in your career?

- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) - Calendly helps you schedule meetings without the back-and-forth emails
- [GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/) - Get Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more for business.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) - Slack gives your team the power and alignment you need to do your best work.

### **#LearnThatTerm**: What does the term `boys club` mean to you?

I've actually seen it where it's not actually just men. It's essentially when you have a group of leaders generally where you have to get their approval to get things done and get where you want to be.

Because of their pre-existing relationships, it's hard for them to look outside of their own circles to look for outside feedback or pespectives.

### **#Friendlies**: What is an organization or affinity group that you would recommend joining?
