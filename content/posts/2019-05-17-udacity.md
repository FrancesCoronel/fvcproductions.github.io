Udacity is where lifelong learners come to learn the skills they need, to land the jobs they want, to build the lives they deserve.

As a contract curriculum developer, I contributed to the new FEND (front end nanodegree) by outlining the initial version of the course material and drafting the capstone project along with two lessons.
