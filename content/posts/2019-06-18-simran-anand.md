Thank you so much for your time last night! I learn so many new things from you every conversation.

Hi Frances!

I hope you are doing well! Thank you so much for speaking with me a couple months ago and helping me navigate my interests in Tech.

Your tips and advice really helped me figure out what classes I should be taking and the types of opportunities I should keep an eye out for. Since then, I've taken on a couple new projects and roles to learn more.

I am in SF this summer working as Software Engineer Intern at Thunkable.
I would love to take you out to lunch or grab a coffee at a time most convenient to you and catch up -- I have been following your blog and would love to hear about the incredible things you have been up to!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi Frances!

Thank you for the links.

After our call yesterday, I learned a lot about the various areas where my interests can take me in the tech industry as well as solidified my resolve to keep pursuing the Joint Major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it all the advice and guidance I got from you! I also loved hearing about your experience in the industry.

I am looking forward to staying connected and I will definitely keep you updated on my progress.

Regards,
Simran

Hi Frances,

I'm Simran (KJ's sister) - he told me you went to Cornell together! I'm pursuing Math and CS at McGill and in the process of searching for internships. I would love to connect and learn about your experience with finding internships, pursuing a CS Degree and your role at Slack!
