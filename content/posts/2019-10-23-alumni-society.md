New Member Spotlight: Frances Coronel

Who: Frances Coronel, software engineer at Slack, codirector of Techqueria

Alma Mater: Cornell Tech (’17)

Her Work: Outside of her role at Slack, Coronel became codirector in August of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Techqueria, which serves the largest community of US Latinos in tech. Techqueria currently has a 15,000+ member reach across multiple online platforms, with more than 4,000 in its core Slack community, of which more than 1,100 members are active weekly and more than 600 are active daily, representing a 400 percent increase in growth over just the past year.

Techqueria has worked with more than fifty organizations, ranging from public tech companies to other nonprofits, and has been instrumental in connecting and growing employee resource groups that serve both Latinx and people of color in tech.

“We’ve done this by providing a platform for tech companies to increase engagement and visibility for D&I efforts by partnering on events, contributing to open-source projects, and facilitating mentorship,” Coronel says.
