Enter Next Chapter: an initiative that we at Slack, in partnership with The Last Mile, the Kellogg Foundation, and FREEAMERICA, have been working on for the past two years to help bring returning citizens back to work and shift perceptions around formerly incarcerated individuals. Through Next Chapter, we are building a year-long apprenticeship program to train and mentor three graduates from The Last Mile â€” and in doing so, we hope to create a blueprint that other companies will use to train and hire talented people who have been incarcerated.

- I volunteered as a student mentor during the first lunch session at Slack on August 1st, 2018 for an hour.
