### Anndrea Moore

- spreadsheet for tracking job applications

- when it comes to prepping for interviews, reach out to your network and use resources like Quora, Glassdoor, Blind, etc.

### April Speight

- develop an online presence
- accepting job with Microsoft
- use folders in your email to keep track of job applications

- when it comes to prepping for interviews, the "tell me about yourself" can seem terrifying but would recommend just telling a story about how your personal experience directly relates to the role you're applying for
- favorite ways to network: Twitter
  - "closed mouths do not get fed"

### Cindy Alvarez

- hiring managers usually don't know how to write job descriptions
- feedback usually isn't given because companies are terrified of liability issues
- candidates will argue back
- in all honesty, if interviewer is asking the "tell me about yourself" question, it is likely to
- favorite ways to network: having people ask you specific questions first like "do you have a book recommendation for xyz?"; asking a small thing first will allow you to ease into a deeper conversation
- use IDE instead of whiteboarding

### Elizabeth Bautista

- create your own job
- if a job wants 5 years of experience, consider that open source work and hackathons you've done, a career development program you've completed - those all tie in and can be considered experience as well
- if candidate gets rejected and the emails are confrontational, they are usually deferred back to the recruiter
- when it comes to prepping for interviews, make sure to prepare with questions that are relevant since you've ideally done your research on the company when it comes to culture, demographics, etc.
- favorite ways to network: prefer to seek out companies I've never heard at career/vendor fairs to talk to the recruiter and learn something new

## Social Impact: The Road Less Traveled...

> I helped Serena debug her technical issues before she started her talk.

Serena works at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She first gave the audience different stats on Latino households...

- 14% without a bank account
- households increased by 167,000
- 31.5% have no mainstream credit
- population grew to 56.5 million or 17% of the total US population
- since 2012, they account for 59% of new home ownership in the country

So seeing these issues down the horizon, she decided to look into creating a website that was created in Spanish and focuses on bank accounts, credit and home buying.

It didn't work out but then her team decided to focus on the portion that got the most traffic and expanded on that which were the single Q&A pages.

> Recap

- inserts on high traffic pages
- improve SEO
