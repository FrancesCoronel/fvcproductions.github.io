## Overview

Hello and welcome to the Tech Queens podcast, a podcast focused on featuring stories and advice from women of color in tech. ðŸ‘‘

In this brief episode, I cover why I decided to start this podcast and what kind of topics it will be covering.Â ðŸ’¬

I released this episode on Friday, March 8th in celebration of [International Women's Day](https://g.co/kgs/Jmsjom). ðŸŽ‰
