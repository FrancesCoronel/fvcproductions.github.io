Put on your wizard hats and join us for a beginner friendly talk about what it's like to be a developer and how you can get started.

Our speaker, Frances Coronel will cover all your standard wizardry topics, like:

- Muggles (the difference between creators and consumers)
- Houses (what kind of software developer positions you can go into)
- Flying (what you can do to become a better developer)
- Potions (what specific tools are out there to help you become a better developer)
- The dark arts (your real reasoning behind wanting to become a developer)
- With a nice a hearty conclusion (ultimately you should forge your own path)
