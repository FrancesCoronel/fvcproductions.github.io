## About

Now known as [Tribe Coliving](https://www.tribecoliving.com/), Founder House is/was a network of interest-based co-living spaces in NYC.

I stayed at their location in Times Square for a semester while at Cornell Tech and I gotta say, it was a pretty positive experience despite the lack of privacy.

I definitely made some lasting connections and will remember my time there for quite some time. ðŸ˜Š
