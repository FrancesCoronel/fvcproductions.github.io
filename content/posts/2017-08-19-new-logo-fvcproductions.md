So with my past logo, a lot of folks would mistake it for a heart.

That was officially a big issue for me so I decided it was time for a brand new logo.

Ergo, I've redesigned the chocolate dipped strawberry that I love so much.

With my new logo, I was inspired by Google's Material Design to re-design my logo to be flat and simple. I wanted to make sure everybody got the idea this time around.

It uses Material Colors and was designed in Sketch.

For wallpapers or covers on my sites, I can now also use this redesigned wallpaper from Prometheus that is also inspired by Google's Material Design principles.
