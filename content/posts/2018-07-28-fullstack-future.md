## About

Expert Silicon Valley technologists deliver keynotes that help fullstack developers prepare for the next decade of programming.

I was invited to speak about Progressive Web Apps on July 28th, 2018 at Infosys in Palo Alto for ~30 minutes at 4 pm.

I believe PWAs represent the next big wave of modern web standards.

<!-- > To Note

I had a feeling from the way everything was setup that the company hosting this event was a little sketchy/off. Also, it's Infosys so it's a pretty crappy company...
