Latinas in Tech: Breaking the Digital Ceiling

The evidence is clear. A more diverse workforce leads to higher revenue for a company and more inventive teams, but despite well-intentioned diversity and inclusion initiatives, minorities and especially Latinas continue to be underrepresented in the tech industry, making up only 1% of working tech professionals. Join us for an honest conversation with Latinas who are breaking the glass ceiling in this male-dominated field to discuss their journey. How were they able to get their foot in the door? How did they find mentors? They‚Äôll answer these questions and break down the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the field.

A big shout out to Diana Rosales and Laura I. G√≥mez for sharing their stories - you two inspire me and I'd love to have you share your stories on the #TechQueens podcast as well. üéôÔ∏è And thank you to Diane from Univision Communications Inc. for moderating and UnidosUS (formerly National Council of La Raza) for providing the opportunity. üíõ #SiSePuede #LatinasInTech"</a></h4><p>August 4, 2019: Frances Coronel posted images on LinkedIn</p></blockquote>
