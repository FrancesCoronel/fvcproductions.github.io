Write/Speak/Code is an intensive, 3-day, hands-on conference with workshops, personalized feedback sessions, panels, and talks by talented technologists with marginalized genders.

This year we’ll have four distinct conference tracks — Write, Speak, Code, and Growth. Each day of the conference, you’ll have the choice of participating in our core curriculum for writing (Friday), speaking (Saturday) or open-source/coding (Sunday) OR attending talks across three other tracks. The choice is yours!

Write/Speak/Code’s core curriculum is designed to help you break down mental blockers, identify and own your expertise, and build a toolkit and body of work around technical blog writing, conference speaking, and open source coding. On each day, attendees leave the conference having developed blog posts and conference talks, making open source contributions, and more. We provide actionable next steps and a supportive community to keep attendees accountable to the goals they set at the conference and beyond.
