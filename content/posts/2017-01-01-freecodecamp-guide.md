Also ended up being asked to be a PR reviewer and this experience was both overwhelming and fun since it was the first time I was a maintainer/reviewer for a very active repo on GitHub. At one point, there were over 5K PRs open...

Here are all the PRs I opened: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+author%3Afvcproductions

And I was the reviewer for about 170 PRs: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3Afvcproductions

Ended up being #6 out of 2,000+ contributors: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide/commits?author=fvcproductions
