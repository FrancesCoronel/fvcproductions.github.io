As a minority woman in tech & politics, what challenges have you faced within both industries?

How do you deal with working in a very niche tech industry like politics and being a minority woman?

What advice would you give to a poc that wanted to get into tech but didn't go to school for it?

I am a Bay Area native and experienced in digital marketing & advertising operations. I have worked in both traditional brand marketing and media planning. Currently working as a Digital Media Planner for Trilogy Interactive, I have contributed to large scale digital campaigns for various clients including the ACLU California, governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee, and California Ballot Propositions 1,2 and 3 in the last 2018 election. As a first-generation American, daughter of refugee Central American immigrants and native Spanish speaker I am proud to be a Latinx in the progressive digital space.
