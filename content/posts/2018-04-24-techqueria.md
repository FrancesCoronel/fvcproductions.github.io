It's been great to work with Frances on the Techqueria.org site. It has become a much more collaborative open-source project with her leadership. I appreciate how she has made the project accessible to both the maintainers and new contributors. She is a great team member and I enjoy maintaining the project with her.

## October 12, 2018 - Testimonial - David Silva Ossa - Founder at Techqueria - Se√±or Developer at Slingshot Health

I've worked with Frances on techqueria, she's leading our website project. We develop the website as an open source project, and she's doing a great job at coordinating the contributions from all the members, developing a roadmap, creating issues, releases, code reviews; all in a very professional manner and with amazing results. It has been a very pleasant experience working together

## April 24, 2018

Spent a whole weekend revamping the existing website of Techqueria using a custom Hugo boilerplate I created called Hugoma.

Still in the process of being integrated into main website at https://techqueria.org - currently at https://beta.techqueria.org.

Helped spearhead creation of `#website` channel in Techqueria's Slack for more collaborative development of the new website.

Source code can be found at https://github.com/techqueria/website.

07/01/19 Hi Frances! I just wanted to reach out and give you a big thank you for all that you do for this community. I‚Äôm so excited to see Techqueria start to reach its potential, and feel empowered to see a badass chica (YOU) take the lead on so many great initiatives. I do my fair share of volunteering with other remote/tech/slack groups, and I know it is A LOT of work. Nevertheless, you are a frontrunner for all of this greatness, so thank you! - Sal Ramirez
