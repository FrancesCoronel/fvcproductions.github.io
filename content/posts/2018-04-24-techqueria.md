## October 17, 2018 - Testimonial - Phillip Ventura - Software Engineer

It's been great to work with Frances on the Techqueria.org site. It has become a much more collaborative open-source project with her leadership. I appreciate how she has made the project accessible to both the maintainers and new contributors. She is a great team member and I enjoy maintaining the project with her.

## October 12, 2018 - Testimonial - David Silva Ossa - Founder at Techqueria - Se√±or Developer at Slingshot Health

I've worked with Frances on techqueria, she's leading our website project. We develop the website as an open source project, and she's doing a great job at coordinating the contributions from all the members, developing a roadmap, creating issues, releases, code reviews; all in a very professional manner and with amazing results. It has been a very pleasant experience working together

Techqueria is one of the largest Latinx in tech organizations in the US, with a presence in the Bay Area, LA, and NYC.

## April 24, 2018

Spent a whole weekend revamping the existing website of Techqueria using a custom Hugo boilerplate I created called Hugoma.

Still in the process of being integrated into main website at https://techqueria.org - currently at https://beta.techqueria.org.

Helped spearhead creation of `#website` channel in Techqueria's Slack for more collaborative development of the new website.

Source code can be found at https://github.com/techqueria/website.
