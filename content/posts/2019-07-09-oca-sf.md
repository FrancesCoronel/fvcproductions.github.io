OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates is dedicated to advancing the social, political, and economic well-being of Asian Pacific Americans

OCA-SF is looking for a panelist to attend our Career Panel on the last day of our OCA Professional Development Program. We'd love to host a panelist who understands the importance of sharing their career experience with 10-15 promising high school youth. The career panel will be the last of a 5-week installment of workshops that address professional development skills such as resume and interview skills, college readiness, self-advocacy, and mental health through a culturally competent lens. Questions will include asking about your career journey, education, words of wisdom you may have for a young person, opportunities you took advantage of, and more.
