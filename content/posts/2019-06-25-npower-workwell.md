8 Mentors will match up with 8 Mentees

After Mentors match up with Mentees they will ask them about where they currently are in the workforce and what interests they have. After the warm intro they will go into Topics of discussion:

- Overall career advice (what it took to get there, the challenges they faced)
- Navigating a male dominated field (how to engage both women and men in growing and supporting women leaders)
- Learning about different industries
- Building a professional network
- Identifying/asking someone to be your mentor
