## Overview

8 Mentors will match up with 8 Mentees

After Mentors match up with Mentees they will ask them about where they currently are in the workforce and what interests they have. After the warm intro they will go into Topics of discussion:

- Overall career advice (what it took to get there, the challenges they faced)
- Navigating a male dominated field (how to engage both women and men in growing and supporting women leaders)
- Learning about different industries
- Building a professional network
- Identifying/asking someone to be your mentor

## Feedback

"Frances has been kind enough to provide me with mentorship as I get started with my career. I have not met anyone as organized with their resources or so quick to offer help so freely. She took the time to sit with me and listen to the kind of work I am looking for when we met and offered to schedule video calls when I needed more in depth advice. Her input on my resume was fresh and insightful - it has improved the way I communicate my worth as a candidate greatly. I highly recommend her as an addition to any team or network." - [Kelley Sharp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelley-sharp/)
