## This is a poem wrote back in the day.

```text
Come, come insects and birds!
Devour and bite, no longer hide.
For this day can no longer get any worse
With Waldo nowhere in sight

Piano playing
Impossible. You're outside.
Hiding behind a masquerade, are you?
The books tilt, the light bulbs twitch.
The deep intuition and wisdom is progressing, yet...
Everything learned will forget to return.

The books on the desk stand up straight
They beckon you to dance with them
Impossible. You're outside.
The womanly mosquito decides to bite its host.
Caring to notice is almost the same as caring about other things.
So it would be best not to.

Yes, very dark outside. A reminder of
That one individual.¬† Breathing in a lonesome world right now indeed.
Those thoughts of "him" are noxious for my brain
With his eyes bluer and deeper as the Mariana trench,
I'm drowning in the sea.

I desire the casual yet I know it is
Time to think of the impossible.
```
