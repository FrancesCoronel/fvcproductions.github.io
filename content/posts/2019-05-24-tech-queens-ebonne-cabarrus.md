## Episode Description

Hello and welcome to the Tech Queens podcast, a podcast focused on featuring stories and advice from women of color in tech. ðŸ‘‘

In this episode, Iâ€™m talking with Ebonne Cabarrus who is currently a student at Make School. She is studying Applied Computer Science and hopes to use these skills to solve real-world problems for underrepresented demographics.

The audio turned out a little rough for this episode so I turned it into a long-form blog post instead. You can find the full interview at [techqueenspod.com/episode-4](https://techqueenspod.com/episode-4). References and links can also be found there.
