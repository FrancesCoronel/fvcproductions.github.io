The theme for this hackathon was "Social Justice" so the way our team approached it was by contributing to OSS projects that benefitted women in tech or organizations that promoted learning how to code.

Our team didn't get in the top three but the judges did give us an honorable mention for trying the non-traditional approach and contributing to open-source during the hackathon which I felt would have a more lasting impact.

We started out with 6 people but by the end, only 3 of us stayed through till the end. üòÖÔ∏è

My lovely team consisted of Rebecca Chen, Ayuna Vogel, Katharina Roesler and Punita Karani - thank you for all your help!

## Presentation

At the core of social justice is the notion of equality of opportunity.

Through the use of F/OSS, tech literacy can be promoted among groups that might not otherwise have access to the tools necessary to build such literacy.

By contributing to open-source projects, we are not only helping promote social justice but also aiding to bridging the digital divide by lowering financial and intellectual property barriers to resources and knowledge.
