The GDG platform is a membership level within the wider Google Developers Community Groups program and it offers tailored support to organizers of local GDG chapters.

GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.

Google Developers supports and recognizes GDG chapters, but doesn't own or manage them.
