## Overview

As people of color working in tech, we are surrounded by stories of success, but rarely do we feel comfortable enough sharing our own missteps.

At Turning #FailureIntoFuego, we’ll welcome a panel of successful Latinx professionals in the tech industry to talk about how they've embraced moments of failure in their careers and turned them into opportunities for growth.

Join us for an inspiring evening with intimate conversation, food and drink, dance lessons and more at Slack HQ in San Francisco, in partnership with Earthtones (Slack's employee resource group for people of color) and The Latinx Collective.

## Recap from Slack

**Turning Failure Into Fuego** 🔥

Last Wednesday on 7/10, we had our first external Earthtones event of 2019 at our HQ in San Francisco. In partnership with the Latinx Collective, we welcomed a panel of successful Latinx professionals in the tech industry to talk about how they have embraced moments of failure in their careers and turned them into opportunities for growth.

A lot of TLC went into crafting the activities for our attendees to remember this momentous occasion — we had salsa dancing lessons hosted by our own @Angela and @Dío 💃🏽, we had a candle making session 🕯️ so you can "take the fuego home", we had a headshot booth station 🖼️ because we know first impressions matter and finally our catering was by the Latina owned Salt & Honey with little tacos 🌮 and pupusas as signature food items.

The event was a smashing success and a lot of the audience members left inspired by the stories told by Elisabeth, Josh, Cat, @victor and @Adri. We had 207 people check in with 145 indicating they were interested in opportunities. I would definitely take a look at all the social media posts since I feel they really show how excited and passionate everyone was. 😊

A big thank you to @Adri @victor @tomiko @Angela @jen @vietsual @frodriguez @vsandovalguerrero @zblackbeard @Jeunée Simon (she/her) @abautista @Dío @mfranco @seanpaul @klind @Monica for all their help - it takes a village!

P.S. For the San Francisco readers: I will be co-hosting an event with Slack Earthtones in San Francisco on July 10th and the topic is how to turn Failure Into Fuego. 🔥🔥

As people of color, we are surrounded by stories of success in the tech industry but not from our own community. Rarely do we feel comfortable enough sharing our mistakes - after all we often have so much more to lose.

It’s going to be such a special event - you’ll hear from a panel of successful Latinx professionals on how they’ve embraced moments of failure in their careers and turned them into opportunities for growth, learn dance lessons (the literal way to learn from missteps), get free headshots and even walk away with some inspiring candles to light that fuego at home.🔥

If you’re in SF that day, RSVP here asap to grab a seat + feel free to forward it to friends & colleagues.

Many thanks to the wonderful Frances Coronel (a long-time subscriber!) who is organizing on the Slack side. 🙌

I’m looking forward to meeting you there.
