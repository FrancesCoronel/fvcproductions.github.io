SMASH Academy, our flagship program, is a three-year STEM- intensive residential college prep program that empowers students to deepen their talents and pursue STEM careers. Every summer, scholars are immersed in tuition-free studies at leading universities throughout the country. During the academic year, scholars participate in monthly programming.

The SMASH Speaker Series connects professionals in the STEM field and beyond with SMASH scholars to introduce them to different backgrounds and academic/career pathways.

During this evening, your experiences and insights will provide our scholars the opportunity to learn various pathways in STEM and other careers, both academically and professionally.
