Way back in the day (not even sure how long ago), I decided to apply for a scholarship competition.

The goal of the competition was to find creative ways to convince people veganism was a good idea.

I've been a vegetarian since 2013 and have remained that way since. Although I have tried veganism, it's still not something I've been commit to.

Nevertheless, I had an idea for the competition that involved a fictional story of how veganism came to play.

After some time, however, I just lost interest and never entered into that competition.

So today, after what has been probably a couple of years, I am happy to announce I have finally finished this little pet project.

Enjoy "A Vegas Tale".
