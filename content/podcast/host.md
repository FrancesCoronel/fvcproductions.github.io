Hi, I'm Frances!

I'm a Latina (Peruvian-American) who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

Or better yet, I'm a [unicorn](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unicorn_(finance)>) (1% of women in tech identify as Latina) who is working for another unicorn ([Slack](https://slack.com?source=fvcproductions)). ðŸ¦„
