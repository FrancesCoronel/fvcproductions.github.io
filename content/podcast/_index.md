## Why?

So after starting to listen to more tech podcasts, I realized a disappointing trend - most of the hosts were white guys. Overwhelmingly so.

But instead of deciding to complain about the lack of good tech podcasts with POC hosts, I instead decided to start my own.

Introducing **Tech Queens**, a podcast that focuses on stories and advice by women of color in tech.

`#TechQueens`

## Who?

In 2015, women made up 25 percent of computing-related occupations.

As Figure 1.1 indicates, levels of participation are even more concerning when it comes to women of color ([NCWIT - Bureau of Labor, 2016](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf)).

In other words, if you are not a white woman - you're a woman of color in tech and should share your story on Tech Queens!
