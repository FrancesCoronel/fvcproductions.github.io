## I enjoy mentoring folks through nonprofit organizations trying to enact change in the tech industry.

Generally speaking, I enjoy providing career advice although I have teachable experience in web development & web design.

I've also had the opportunity to tutor folks at all ages (elementary school to adulthood) on how to get started in the tech field.

You can find [the feedback I've received thus far](/reviews/ "Feedback") on my website and if you're interested in being mentored, you can [contact me](/contact/ "Contact Me").
