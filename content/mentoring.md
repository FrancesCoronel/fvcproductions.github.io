I've had opportunity to tutor folks at all ages (elementary school to adulthood) on how to get started in the tech field.

I also enjoy mentoring others through external organizations trying to enact change in the tech industry.

Some of these organizations include:

- [Code 2040](http://www.code2040.org/)
- [Code.org](https://code.org/)
- [CodeNow](https://www.codenow.org/)
- [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/)
- [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/)
- [Out of Office Hours](https://www.outofofficehours.com/)
- [The Next Chapter](https://slackhq.com/next-chapter-a-pilot-program-aiming-to-help-formerly-incarcerated-individuals-find-work-and-succeed-in-tech)
- [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com)
- [Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY)](https://witny.tech.cornell.edu/)

Generally speaking, I enjoy providing career or job search advice although I have teachable experience in web development & web design.
