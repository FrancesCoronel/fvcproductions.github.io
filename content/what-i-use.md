## Hardware

### Headphones

I won a pair of [Bose headphones](https://bose.com/en_us/products/headphones.html?source=fvcproductions) at [the TAPIA conference in 2016](/2016/09/16/tapia-2016/) from a Dropbox raffle so I use those basically all the time.

### Phone

I decided to switch from an iPhone 6 to a [Google Pixel 2](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_2?source=fvcproductions) back in April 2014.

So far, I'm **extremely** satisfied with the transition. I now have a [Pixel 3](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3?source=fvcproductions).

### Computer

I have the same laptop for both work and not (?) work.

![macOS](https://i.imgur.com/4Xv2LhE.png)

But tbh, once some company comes out with a cheaper high performing laptop that has a better user experience than macOS, I'm gonna switch again (probably to [ChromeOS](https://www.google.com/chromebook?source=fvcproductions)).

### Monitor

Got this [29" UltraWide IPS LED Gaming Monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-29UM57-P-ultrawide-led-monitor?source=fvcproductions) off Craigslist for <!-- prettier-ignore -->$180 - it gets the jobs done.
