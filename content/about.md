Hi, I'm Frances! 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer at Slack who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

## Blurb

I like to dabble with things that ~~shouldn't~~ ought to be dabbled with.

Well, at least... that's my slogan.

My "life motto", if you will.

Might have something to do with human nature in general, though, so interpret it as you will.

- Latina (2nd gen. Peruvian-American) 🇵🇪️ who gets a lot of personal satisfaction out of inspiring underserved groups within the tech industry 😊

## FVCproductions?

### First Person

FVCproductions is my freelancing company that provides technical mentorship, web services, and speaking engagements.

It is also the personal brand that I've been using since 2013 to identify my work across the interwebs.

Starting in May 2015, I started working with her first client and initially introduced FVCproductions as a freelancing company for web design & development before adding in mentorship sessions and speaking engagements as other services offered.

All in all, FVCproductions is how I'm trying to give back to the community.
