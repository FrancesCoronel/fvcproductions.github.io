Hi, I'm Frances! üëãüèΩ

I'm a software engineer at Slack who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

## Blurb

I like to dabble with things that ~~shouldn't~~ ought to be dabbled with.

Well, at least... that's my slogan.

My "life motto", if you will.

Might have something to do with human nature in general, though, so interpret it as you will.
