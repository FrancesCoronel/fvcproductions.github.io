Hi, I'm Frances!

I'm a Latina (Peruvian-American) who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

Or better yet, I'm a [unicorn](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unicorn_(finance)>) (1% of women in tech identify as Latina) who is working for another unicorn ([Slack](https://slack.com?source=fvcproductions)). 🦄

## Blurb

I like to dabble with things that ~~shouldn't~~ ought to be dabbled with.

Well, at least... that's my slogan.

My "life motto", if you will.

Might have something to do with human nature in general, though, so interpret it as you will.

- Front End Engineer at Slack HQ in SF with a focus on UI design & development 🖌️🔧️
- Latina (2nd gen. Peruvian-American) 🇵🇪️ who gets a lot of personal satisfaction out of inspiring underserved groups within the tech industry 😊
- Passionate mentor, freelancer & speaker 💬️
