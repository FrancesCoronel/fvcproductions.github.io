You can [connect with me through LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions) if you'd like to be on the podcast or you can also fill out the [contact form](/tech-queens/contact-form).

If we’re not connected already, feel free to send an invite over and I’ll happily accept.

We will be using LinkedIn to message each other and coordinate on assets, etc.

## 2. Schedule an initial chat via Calendly 📆

To schedule our episode recording, we first need to set up a 30-minute chat to discuss logistics and any question you might have.

Once we are connected through LinkedIn, I will send you over the link to book the initial 30 minute chat which would be [calendly.com/fvcproductions](https://calendly.com/fvcproductions)

During this chat, I'll go over the episode format, action items and be able to answer any questions, comments or concerns you might have.

You can specify through the Calendly platform if you want to chat either online or in-person at Slack’s HQ if you’re based in San Francisco.

## 3. Go over the questions, guidelines & recommendations 🧠

### Questions <!-- omit in toc -->

The questions I will ask will be something along the lines of this:

> FYI, the Google Doc will always have the most updated list of these questions.

- What’s your story?
- What are you currently doing?
- Where is your family from?
- What was your favorite part about growing up?
- What do you like to do for fun? What are you passionate about outside of work/school?
- What experiences drew you to the field of technology?
- As a minority woman in tech, what challenges or obstacles have you faced within the tech industry?
- What groups, strategies or tools have you used to overcome those obstacles?
- If you could give any advice to your younger self as you were starting out, what would it be?
- What do you think can be done to create a safer space for us?
- If you were in a position of power at a tech company, what’s the first thing you would do to create a more inclusive space?
- How does your intersectional identity affect how you relate to women in tech groups?
- What woman inspires you and why?
- What do they believe that young women need to know/hear/see to consider technology as a career option?
- How can a more privileged ally help out? What can they do to educate themselves better on our issues?
- Is there anything I left out that you’d like to address?
- Any call to actions you want to share?

### Mini Takeaways <!-- omit in toc -->

I want listeners to come away with useful takeaways so I will always ask these questions at the end.

- What is a useful app or platform that has helped you grow in your career? `#AppAdvice`
- What does the term XYZ mean to you? `#LearnThatTerm` (you will provide the term XYZ)
- What is an organization or affinity group that you would recommend joining? `#Friendlies`
- Where do you live online or how can people reach out to you? `#GrowYourNetwork`

### Guidelines <!-- omit in toc -->

#### Feelings <!-- omit in toc -->

Feelings are great, stories are better

Feel free to get specific about your experiences and provide examples on what you're talking about

#### Jargon <!-- omit in toc -->

Try to define any industry specific terms you use

It’s okay to use jargon but we just want to make sure no one is left out of the conversation

#### Profanity <!-- omit in toc -->

You are welcome to use profanity but I recommend not forcing it.

Just speak in whatever way makes you feel the most comfortable.

### Recommendations <!-- omit in toc -->

#### Breathing <!-- omit in toc -->

Try to breathe through your nose and not through your mouth as this interferes with the audio.

If you do need to catch your breath, no worries! Just let me know so then I can edit it out later.

#### Crutch Words <!-- omit in toc -->

I also recommend educating yourself a little bit on “crutch words” and how you can avoid them.

I use crutch words myself quite a lot so it’s alright if you do use them but even so, just being aware of what they are can help a lot.

> If you want to record in person, the next section isn't relevant and I will provide more details when we chat.

## 4. Schedule the actual recording session via Calendly 🎙️

**ACTION ITEM** After the initial chat, you can book the actual recording session using [calendly.com/techqueenspod/book-session](https://calendly.com/techqueenspod/book-session).

For remote sessions, a unique SquadCast link will be included in the calendar invite.

Here's an example of a SquadCast link so you can play around with it: https://squadcast.page.link/bMoi

For in-person sessions, arrival instructions will be included instead.

## 5. Send me the SVG file of your avatar created from the generator 🖼️

Create your avatar using [the avataaars generator](https://getavataaars.com/) using the transparent background setting.

This avatar will be used to create the banner like the one below for the episode banner.

![Tech Queens - Episode 1](/assets/img/podcast/episodes/tech-queens-frances-coronel.jpg)

**ACTION ITEM** Send me the SVG file of your finished avatar via LinkedIn.

## 6. Send me a high-res photo of yourself 📸

I will feature this image in the episode link so everyone can see your lovely face!

**ACTION ITEM** Send me this image via LinkedIn and please make sure it's at least 1000 pixels in width.

## 7. Make a copy of the Tech Queens Podcast Template using Google Docs and share it with me via LinkedIn 📝

**ACTION ITEM** Make a copy of [this Google Doc](https://bit.ly/tech-queens-podcast-template) and share your copy with me via LinkedIn with edit access.

This Google Doc contains the intro template, pre-defined questions, mini-takeaway questions and the outro.

You are more than welcome to edit this doc to your heart's desire since I want you to be in control of the conversation as well!

## 8. Record the podcast episode with me 👑

We will be recording the session using [SquadCast](https://squadcast.fm/#/home).

If you’ve never used SquadCast before, it basically allows podcast hosts & guests to record studio quality audio from anywhere.

### Equipment <!-- omit in toc -->

Have headphones and a good mic ready.

If you don’t have a dedicated mic, that’s okay but if you wanted to invest in one, I recommend the [Blue Snowball mic](https://amzn.to/2JBrLzb).

![Blue Snowball Mic Image](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B014PYGTUQ&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=fvcproduction-20)

### Location <!-- omit in toc -->

Find a place that is comfortable and quiet so there’s little to no background noise.

We want to make sure there is little interference with our voices so our listeners can have a pleasant experience.

### WiFi <!-- omit in toc -->

Try to connect to the internet via Ethernet if you can.

Or if you’re using WiFi, try to be as physically close to the router as possible.

## 9. Once the episode is published, share on social media & celebrate so more women of color in tech can learn about Tech Queens 🎉

**ACTION ITEM** Share the news that you’ll be on the podcast on your social media platforms.

You can find image assets and social media templates below.

You don’t have to use these but this way, you have something to go off of!

All the templates are under 280 characters so that it can be shared across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
