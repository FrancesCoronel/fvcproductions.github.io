## Why start this podcast?

So after starting to listen to more tech podcasts, I realized a disappointing trend - most of the hosts were white guys. Overwhelmingly so.

But instead of deciding to complain about the lack of good tech podcasts with POC hosts, I instead decided to start my own.

Introducing **Tech Queens**, the first and only podcast I know of that will solely focus on the stories and advice shared by women of color in tech.

`#TechQueens`

## Who is this podcast for?

In 2015, women made up 25 percent of computing-related occupations.

As Figure 1.1 indicates, levels of participation are even more concerning when it comes to women of color ([NCWIT - Bureau of Labor, 2016](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf)).

The stat above is just one part of the reason this podcast will exclusively serve to highlight thriving women of color in tech and inspire or encourage others to enter the industry and thrive themselves so they too can leverage their unique skills and perspectives for technological innovation and social change in the workplace of the future.

## Who is the host?

Hi, I'm Frances!

I'm a Latina (Peruvian-American) who engineers solutions to make your working life more simple, more pleasant and more productive.

Or better yet, I'm a [unicorn](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unicorn_(finance)>) (1% of women in tech identify as Latina) who is working for another unicorn ([Slack](https://slack.com?source=fvcproductions)). ü¶Ñ You can find more deets on my [about page](/about).

## When will the episodes be published?

I plan on releasing an episode every 2 weeks.

## How will the episodes be formatted?

The format for each 1 hour session will look something like this:

- What's your story?
- As a minority women in tech, what challenges or obstacles have you faced within the tech industry?
- What groups, strategies or tools have you used to overcome those obstacles?
- If you were a white man in tech, what do you think would be easier for you to deal with (if anything)?
- If you could give any advice to your younger self as you were starting out, what would it be?
- What do you think can be done to create a safer space for us?
