## Twitter üê¶

For a quick question, feel free to [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fvcproductions).

## LinkedIn üíºÔ∏è

If you'd like to stay in touch professionally, don't hesitate to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fvcproductions).

## Book a Chat üìÖ

You can schedule a time to chat with me using [my Calendly](https://calendly.com/fvcproductions).

For mentoring, the first 30 minute session you book with me is free in exchange for [a LinkedIn recommendation](https://www.linkedin.com/recs/give?senderId=fvcproductions) submitted after the session.

For following sessions, I charge 25 dollars for every 30 minutes.

By agreeing to the mentoring session, you also agree to have yourself added to [the mentees section of my website](/mentoring/).

You can pay through [Square Cash](https://cash.me/fvcprdxs) or [Venmo](https://venmo.com/fvcproductions) but I'm flexible with platforms.

Please make sure to pay this amount before booking a mentoring session through my Calendly or I will have to reschedule/cancel the session.

## Invite Me to Speak üí¨

For speaking engagements, I require an honorarium. For events outside San Francisco, I also require reimbursement for flights, ground transportation, hotel accomodations and meals. I am flexible to negotiation on the honorarium for community-driven or non-profit events.

You can find my bio and headshot phot on [my about page](/about/).

You can find all the events I've spoken at [my speaking page](/speaking/) and a sampling of the different types of talks I've given [on my talks page](/talks/).

If you are interested in inviting me to speak, please feel free to use the contact form above and be sure to touch on the points below.

- What are the topics to be covered in the talk?
- What does the audience makeup look like?
- What is the expected number of attendees for my talk or the event overall?
- What is the budget for honorariums?
- What is the budget for travel/hotel?
