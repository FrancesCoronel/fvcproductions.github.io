## Java Talk

### Baruch College - CUNY

#### New York City, NY

<p class="intro">Java Talk is a WiTNY program designed specifically for undergraduate CUNY women with an interest in computer science and technology. The beta CUNY School is Baruch College.</p>

The goal of Java Talk is to create an opportunity for young women with an interest in a career in tech to have a brief, informative, informal conversation with a professional.

The Java Talk program will:

- Allow students to have one-on-one open interactions with professionals in the tech sector
- Help students learn more about a career path with a focus in technology and entrepreneurship
- Provide a vehicle for transferring technical as well as formal and informal industry-related and career-focused knowledge

<p class="intro">Through this program, I was given the chance to mentor a CIS major at CUNY. I personally enjoyed the mentoring session a lot and look forward to participating in similar events in the future.</p>

The goal of Java Talk is to create an opportunity for young women with
an interest in a career in tech to have a brief, informative, informal
conversation with a professional.

The Java Talk program will:
