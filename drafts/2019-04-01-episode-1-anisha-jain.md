### What does the term imposter syndrome mean to you and how has it impacted your career? #LearnThatTerm

[Impostor syndrome](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Impostor_syndrome) (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be.

While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally.

### What is an organization or affinity group that you would recommend joining? #Friendlies

[Girls Teaching Girls to Code](http://girlsteachinggirlstocode.org/index.html) is a program where college women teach and inspire Bay Area high school girls to explore Computer Science and Engineering. Students learn coding basics, build exciting projects, and develop strong relationships with mentors in the field.
