The Center for WorkLife Law is partnering with the Women of Color in Computing Collaborative to learn more about the types of bias that occur in the tech industry. Using a combination of surveys and interviews, the Center is contributing to research on bias that women in the tech industry face based on gender, race, child-care responsibilities, and other individual characteristics. During the interview, you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to our understanding of workplace bias dynamics in tech companies and other computing settings.

Sent a small present as a gift for my efforts to recruit other Latinas in tech to give interviews

```txt
Hi Frances, I would like to send you a small present and thanks for your being so generous with your time, and your effort in reaching out to the Latinas listserv – a copy of the book I wrote with my daughter about how women navigate successfully through subtle gender bias at work, called What Works for Women at Work, and the accompanying workbook, if you would like them. If you would, just send us your snail mail address, and hit reply all when you do.
