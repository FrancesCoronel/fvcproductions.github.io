### **#LearnThatTerm**: What does the term imposter syndrome mean to you and how has it impacted your career?

I think it's the little things - the moments where you could have gotten an opportunity but you didn't say anything because you didn't believe in yourself. But I've been working on it - knowing it's okay to be wrong - I think it helps to realize that the way to learn is making mistakes and getting it wrong so you can then get it right.

### **#Friendlies**: What is an organization or affinity group that you would recommend joining?

Students learn coding basics, build exciting projects, and develop strong relationships with mentors in the field.
