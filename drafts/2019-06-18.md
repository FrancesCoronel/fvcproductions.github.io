Hi Frances!

I hope you are doing well! Thank you so much for speaking with me a couple months ago and helping me navigate my interests in Tech.

Your tips and advice really helped me figure out what classes I should be taking and the types of opportunities I should keep an eye out for. Since then, I've taken on a couple new projects and roles to learn more.

I am in SF this summer working as Software Engineer Intern at Thunkable.
I would love to take you out to lunch or grab a coffee at a time most convenient to you and catch up -- I have been following your blog and would love to hear about the incredible things you have been up to!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi. Frances,

I'm Simran (KJ's sister) - he told me you went to Cornell together! I'm pursuing Math and CS at McGill and in the process of searching for internships. I would love to connect and learn about your experience with finding internships, pursuing a CS Degree and your role at Slack!
