This was a beautiful project. A lot of attention paid to those design details, and I noticed the colors match our branding. This was definitely a project made with a lot of care for everyone including fellow developers. This is probably one of the best readmes I've seen on a project.

The implementation is fairly simple, but to me that's a big plus that they didn't over-engineer. I did wish they used just a bit more CSS to take advantage of responsiveness and show more of the image without strange cropping or tried to implement more effective performance upgrades like preloading images or loading smaller thumbnails!

I docked very few points for the following:
• No Keyboard shortcuts and a few cases where a link was used instead of a button.
• Most of the code is in one commit, but after that commit the messages were pretty solid.

These are things I noticed and would ask questions about.
• Why use preload for something you're loading later in the page? What would be a better use of preload?
• I'd ask about some of the extra meta properties in the head: Why disable translation?
