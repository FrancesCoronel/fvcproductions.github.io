Hey there!

You may have noticed it's been a while since I've posted anything.

Rest assured there is a lot I could indeed post (18+ commmunity engagements so far this year!) but I have been beyond busy with my new role at Techqueria and I just got promoted at Slack so I don't really foresee having a lot of free time to blog like I used to. ðŸ˜”

However, I don't really see this is a bad thing. In fact, if anything, it was inevitable.

Hence why I'm planning my next move for this blog. I think I may end up going back to Wordpress...

Yeah I said it... Wordpress.

As much as I love maintaining my website and getting to experiment with all the latest and greatest technologies through it, I don't see how that will work long-term (like sustainably).

When I first started this blog in 2013, I was just starting to learn how to code. As I became a better web developer, I took a stab at creating my own site and from there, the creation that you see now became more and more complex and beautiful (although really more complex who are we kidding lol).

So it is with great relief and initial discomfort that I state I will once again embark on a migration journey to Wordpress.

When I first left Wordpress.com for static site generators a few years back, I felt I made the right choice. I would get more flexibility and control over my content and be as creative as I wanted. Instead of a bulky CMS, I would get a site I could customize to be heart's desire!

Well, I don't want to be creative anymore, people! I want to just be able to open an editor, type type type and then hit publish without worrying about whether one of npm packages will break or my webpack config/hugo config no longer works with the latest update.

I recognize I'll be leaving a lot on the table: better performance, more minute control over design, bragging rights about my site being open source.

HOWEVER, I am very much willing to give that up right now due to the fact that I foresee I have graduated from personal website maintainer to lazy website maintainer because I'm too busy maintaining my life. And unfortunately or not, I don't see myself regressing back to even just last year when I had more time and could dedicate at least an hour a week to looking at my site and seeing it to be beautiful.

**TLDR; I'm migrating this site back to Wordpress so I can focus more on content creation instead of more minute stuff. Pricing is no longer an issue so Wordpress is best long-term bet for where my content can live.**
