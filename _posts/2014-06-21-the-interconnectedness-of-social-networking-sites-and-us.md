So, I've made a somewhat interesting discovery.

Discovery\_8Pm:
---------------

When one has an account with all these different social networking sites
(I have a few of these myself, actually), specifically:

1.  [Google+](https://www.google.com/+/learnmore/) (the Facebook
    wanna-be)
2.  [Behance](https://www.behance.net) (where creativity can be
    unleashed)
3.  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) (making business people look
    good)
4.  [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com) (professional looking posts)
5.  [Quora](https://www.quora.com) (questions and answers)
6.  [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) (diverse posts)
7.  [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) (music)
8.  [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com) (high quality videos)
9.  [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) (documents/books)
10. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) (the best and worst videos)
11. [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) (tweet, tweet)
12. [Quizlet](https://www.quizlet.com) (quizzes all abound)
13. [a Facebook Account](https://www.facebook.com) (casual stalking)
14. [a Facebook
    Page](https://www.facebook.com/help/174987089221178 "What is a Facebook Page?")
    (organization stalking)

there's a lot one can't not do. Which is exciting.

The arrow represents the possibilities each social network has with
every other in terms of connecting/sharing/publishing.

For example, with the above digram, anything you publish to Behance can
automatically be published to Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter (the mega
god of connecting according to these 2 diagrams I made). So many
connections and options, it's hard to believe people haven't created
this sort of global application that can access any of your sites and
just publish simultaneously whatever material you want to any site you
want (I mean, besides HootSuite - the UI looks quite unappealing for
their Social Media Management App...).

There's also another version of the same diagram below, formatted
differently. I prefer the one that looks like this circle where
everything goes round and round, infinitely.

It's clear then that the average one essentially has no need for
[IFTT](https://ifttt.com)!

[IFTT](https://ifttt.com), by the way, is the utility that promises to
put the Internet to work for you. A few examples of how IFTT are shown
below.

.size-full width="676" height="647"} Vimeo, Twitter, Tumblr, and
Wordpress are all producing output to the Facebook Page which then
receives it as a form of input\[/caption\]

Mind you, I mean that IFTT is not really necessary at all for the
*average* Internet user.

These social networking sites have become SUPER efficient at making sure
everything ends up looking like the Version 1 diagram - a sort of cloud
of connections - but derp - of course it looks like a cloud. -\_-

Regardless, if you don't use IFTT the right way, your Facebook page
could end up looking something like this:

\[caption id="attachment\_768" align="aligncenter" width="499"\]![Screen

.size-full width="499" height="644"} So many connections - ergo, so many
reposts of the same exact thing!!!\[/caption\]

So focusing on the Facebook page, we get a diagram that looks like this:

.size-full width="716" height="566"} All the links to the Facebook
Page\[/caption\]

That's not to say IFTT is not totally lost with all these social
networking sites having the options there.

I myself still use IFTT for making personal recipes and using the [most
useful, popular ones](https://ifttt.com/recipes#popular), like backing
up my Apple contacts to Google, updating profile pictures
simultaneously, sending emails at certain times, etc. Here's an example
I still use today:

.size-full width="712" height="228"} Behance project feed to Tumblr
blog\[/caption\]

At the core of its own recipe, IFTT has a simple if-statement one could
find in a beginner programming class, which I find amusing/amazing since
IFTT has attempted (successfully, in my opinion) to control the vast
entity known as the Internet.

Any whoozies, all this time, I've really just been contemplating how
much closer everyone really is to each other virtually and trying to
prove that to myself through these visually off-putting diagrams I
decided to type up last month.

And all the while, I'll be waiting eagerly/cautiously of the moment
where some sort of revolutionary virtual/biological "Grid" is created
and everyone is truly connected one way or another. Could end up bad,
though. [Really
bad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzryBRPwsog "Plurality.") Well...

:twisted:
