I decided to take the **[Design
101](https://trydesignlab.com/web-design-course/)** course on Designlab
to get a better understanding of how design can be incorporated into my
work. You can view the syllabus
[here](https://storage.trydesignlab.com/syllabus/design-101.pdf).

Date & Times {#section-date}
------------

  **Start Date**             **End Date**               **My Actual End Date**
  -------------------------- -------------------------- ---------------------------
  Friday - August 28, 2015   Friday - October 9, 2015   Sunday - October 18, 2015

Even though it ended October 9, it took me another 9 days to finish
everything up.

So, finally, on Sunday, October 18th, I managed to finish all the
required coursework - woot, woot!

I received a few items in the mail August 31st - ooh la la. The book
“Steal Like An Artist” was included as part of the package and even
though I had read it already, it was nice having a physical copy. Even
my mom ended up reading it and will quote from the book now and then.

My Mentor {#section-mentor}

[My mentor,
]{style="line-height:1.75;"}[Chad](https://chadtrutt.com/ "Chad Trutt")[
was pretty cool. I checked ]{style="line-height:1.75;"}out h[is website
and he has some killer work, like this
pepper:]{style="line-height:1.75;"}

But to be honest, we only ended up Skyping each other once because I was
always busy or had something going on that was of higher priority. This
was on me.

Regardless, becoming the marvelous mentor he is, Chad always made sure
to give me helpful feedback, even after the course was technically over
for me! :)

The Lessons {#section-lessons}

Designlab - Week 1\[/caption\]

These are already on their website, but I will share again here.

1. Getting to Know Design
2. Visual Hierarchy
3. Layout
4.  Typography
5.  Color Theory
6.  Process

Each unit had designated projects and with each project, there were
several articles that were optional to read. Most of the articles were
pretty helpful and were all available for free online.

The Projects {#section-projects}
------------

I’m still pretty new to the world of design. Even though I already knew
the difference between UX/UI, how a wireframe is different from a
prototype, and how important design is in general, **Designlab** was
still made me realize how much more complex design can really be even
when your only goal is simplicity.

I explored each project more in depth [on this
page](https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/designlab-submissions/), but
you’re also free to look at it on [my Behance
portfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29117121/My-Designlab-Experience)
as well.

The Difference {#section-difference}
--------------

The difference, I believe, between something
like [DailyUI](https://chadtrutt.com/ "Chad Trutt") challenges and
[Designlab](https://trydesignlab.com "Designlab") is the amount of
feedback you’re going to get. I feel the main thing you’re paying for is
the community and feedback. The articles they provide as mini-lessons
before each project are all actually free online somewhere, but,
nonetheless, they were **very** well selected.

Designlab - Course Completion\[/caption\]

Upon course completion, I received a [nice online
certificate](https://trydesignlab.com/certificates/design-101/fvcproductions/)
which I promptly added to my LinkedIn (they made this really easy to
do).

The certificate itself is actually nothing more than a showcasing of all
the design projects I completed for the course.

> Overall, the course was definitely worth the \$274. I would learn with
> Designlab again!
