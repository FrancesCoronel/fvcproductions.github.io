So this week, I signed up as a `technical volunteer` for the [**Hour of Code**](https://hourofcode.com/us). {#so-this-week-i-signed-up-as-a-technical-volunteer-for-the-hour-of-code. .intro style="text-align:center;"}

[Code.org](https://code.org) is sponsoring a whole week (December 7th to 13th) of CS education through their Hour of Code event.[\

Quite a few schools reached out to me, but, of course, I couldn’t
volunteer with some of them due to constraints in my class schedule or
because they were just too far away.

I, along with [an ODU student](https://thecbliss.com/), decided to go
ahead and even attend a [**Professional Development
Workshop**](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) for the
Hour of Code so we could be better prepared to assist the kids. The
session was held at [CAML Academy](https://camlacademy.com/) in North
Carolina and was roughly **3.5 hours away**.Thankfully, it was a
Saturday.

### So in the end, I decided to volunteer throughout the week for 4 different schools: [Bethel High School](https://bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), [Sedgefield Elementary School](https://sedgefield.nn.k12.va.us/), [John B. Dey Elementary School](https://www.deyes.vbschools.com/), and [Tallwood Elementary School](https://www.tallwoodes.vbschools.com/). {#so-in-the-end-i-decided-to-volunteer-throughout-the-week-for-4-different-schools-bethel-high-school-sedgefield-elementary-schooljohn-b.-dey-elementary-school-and-tallwood-elementary-school. .intro}

I created two different presentations, one for *high schoolers* and one
for *elementary schoolers*.

Hour of Code Presentations {#hourofcodepresentation style="text-align:center;"}
--------------------------

 

### High School Version

At [`Bethel High School`](https://bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), I presented
and helped out with **3 classes** that were all taught by
`Mrs. Ai Choo Ashe`. I gave a roughly 30-minute presentation to each
class using the slides below. The classes were related to digital
media/game development/animation so the students were learning how to
use software like GameMaker & Adobe Photoshop. I gave away all my free
swag I got from Code.org to Mrs. Ashe because she deserved it. I kept
the water bottle and a sticker, though. They were too useful to pass up.

### Elementary School Version

At [`Sedgefield Elementary School`](https://bhs.hampton.k12.va.us/), I
gave a presentation to a class of 3rd graders on why it’s important to
learn how to code. The teachers in charge were so nice and supportive of
the kids. I found it funny how much more the 3rd graders participated
than the high schoolers, but hey.
