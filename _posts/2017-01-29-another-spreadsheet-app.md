# Google Sheets. Excel.

### The two options most folks think about when they want to create a spreadsheet. 🙄

But not me. No, no, no.

You see, I've been using this platform called [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) for a month now and I can't even imagine doing anything in Google Sheets, let alone Excel, any longer. 😊

### **ANOTHER spreadsheet app? What's the big deal? 👿** {#another-spreadsheet-app-whats-the-big-deal style="text-align:center;"}

To be fair, I'm not in a job that requires the use of either but in
terms of organizing data, I have found it useful to utilize spreadsheets
in the past to keep track of a variety of different things. However,
Google Sheets proved to be far too clunky with a spotty UI for
organizing files.

Wth [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com), I feel like I can find whatever
I need to in a breeze because of how easy it is to access just about any
piece of data you've stored in it. The interface is seamless across
mobile and the web, I can share and export to whatever I want, and I can
even sync data with my calendar.

So far, I've been using [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) to keep
track of deadlines, college courses, mentoring sessions, job
applications, test scores, awards, all sorts of things! 🛠

My favorite aspect of Airtable is how easy it is to share everything. If
I'm working on a table that involves deadlines, I can send someone a
calendar view or just sync my calendar so I know exactly when everything
is due (very handy for job apps). 📆

![screen\_shot\_2016-08-10\_at\_11-43-02\_am](https://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screen_shot_2016-08-10_at_11-43-02_am.png){.size-full

I can send a stand alone link to just view the specific table I'm
logging in or all of them at once. Despite the complexity involved
throughout the app, the UI makes it easy to navigate and do just about
anything without having to reference documentation.

Plus, there are so many base templates to choose from! 😲

But what I find interesting about [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) is
that they were able to break into a seemingly boring and crowded market
(spreadsheets) and still get tons of users onboard because they put the
experience of their users first. That's
why [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) has been able to raise - get
this -

Investors](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airtable/investors).
For just some spreadsheet app, that's quite a bit of moolah. 💰💰💰

Now, no app is perfect. I've found that in my experience
with [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) that formula-heavy projects
probably wouldn't be suitable for it and I'd be better off using
something else.

Ergo, if the main purpose of your project is to run calculations (with
accounting for example) or test hypothesis (for a business model),
then [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) is probably still too minimal
for that kind of work.

But for anything else, [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com) powers over
the rest every time and remains my tool of choice for anything
spreadsheet related! 😉

So stop stressing out over formatting and cell management & just **[Airtable](http://airtable.com)**! 🎉 {#so-stop-stressing-out-over-formatting-and-cell-management-justairtable .qtext_para}
