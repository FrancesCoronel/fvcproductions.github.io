So this past winter, I applied to [**Bitmaker
Labs**](http://bitmakerlabs.com "BitmakerLabs") for their summer 2014
full-time web development immersive course and was luckily accepted.

Bitmaker Labs is a coding boot camp located in Toronto, Canada that
focuses on making curious people great web developers within 9 weeks.

*Unfortunately*, I won't be able to attend given that I have mandatory
school courses I have to take, but for anyone looking to learn more
about coding, specifically within web development, I'd definitely
recommend this one.

Not only do they have a web-development immersive session, they also
specialize in iOS dev and UI design.

The people who interviewed me were extremely amiable and I never felt
too antsy all throughout the process.

You can learn more about Bitmaker Labs courses ¬†at their wonderfully
designed website located
[here](http://bitmakerlabs.com/courses/ "Bitmaker Lab Courses").

Bitmaker Labs definitely sounds like a worthy investment, so don't
hesitate!

Oh, and then actually make sure your schedule works around it. It'll
save you some trouble.

I've also included the curriculum¬†they sent me while I was involved in
the application process. Here it is:
