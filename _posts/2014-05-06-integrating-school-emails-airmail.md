So I have 4 different email accounts, my personal one, and then 3 other
ones for the different universities I’ll be attending this summer for
classes (YEAHHHH, it’s a drag).

1.  Personal email *@gmail.com*
2.  Hampton University Email *@hamptonu.edu*
3.  Old Dominion University Email *@odu.edu*
4.  VCCS Email *@email.vccs.edu*

So anyhow, I figured I’d make it easier for myself and go ahead and use
[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com) to integrate everything into one place.

This is the story of that plan which initially
[kinda]{#4c0251db-b18e-4b33-bd9b-bf57b5773900 .GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark}
failed, but was then successful. Kudos to Airmail for being generally
awesome.

You may carry on now...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrating my personal email was very easy, I didn’t even have to do
anything too advanced.

This is how it ended up looking like in the Account Preferences pane for
[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com).

*However*, if you have the 2-step security enabled for your Gmail
account (I do), you will have to create an [app-specific
password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en),
which really isn’t too hard at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SO** Then I went on to my VCCS email. This too was very easy to
integrate. I just chugged in my email and was set.

Looks pretty much exactly like the settings for the personal gmail
account.

Most school emails utilize Gmail, so that’s going to end up happening,
obviously...

VCCS email set-up\[/caption\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After VCCS was set, I looked closer first at what ODU could do for me,
and it turns out, I actually needed to set up an app-specific password
through MIDAS, which is the **[Monarch Identification and Authorization
System](https://midas.odu.edu)** that ODU has for all their students.

So anyhow, if you’re an ODU student and you want to integrate your
school email with a separate application, you’re going to want to go to
your MIDAS page where you will conveniently come across a section that
looks like this:

\[caption id="attachment\_464" align="aligncenter" width="696"\][![MIDAS
home
page](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-4-53-53-pm.png){.size-full

height="238"}](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-4-53-53-pm.png)
MIDAS home page\[/caption\]

There you will click on the *Gmail and Google Apps for Students and
Alumni* link where you will be redirected to a page that looks like
this:

\[caption id="attachment\_465" align="aligncenter" width="696"\][![Gmail
and Google Apps on
MIDAS](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-4-55-04-pm.png){.size-full
.wp-image-465 width="696"

Gmail and Google Apps on MIDAS\[/caption\]

This is where you are going to want to click where it says *Set a
service-specific password* and set up a password. Done!

Okay, now that you have your app-specific password, you can use that
password to set up that [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com) account.

This probably applies [for]{#2b33936a-c595-4c6c-886a-1a60f475e4a2
.GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark} other universities for similar security settings,
but if that doesn't work out, there's always the last resort method I
thought of...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**You see**, soon enough I found out I was unable to integrate the last
of my three school emails (@hamptonu.edu).

[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com) just couldn’t validate it. This is what
popped up when I tried to add that particular school account.

\[caption id="attachment\_460" align="aligncenter"

Airmail [fail]{#2055bb99-fa10-453b-b4b8-694118f3b107
.GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark}\[/caption\]

I couldn't add an app-specific password, enabling IMAP did nothing, I
used all my different school passwords, different port numbers,
yadda yadda, nothing.

The trick here apparently is to resort to old-fashioned methods...

You are going to need to go directly to the Gmail account that is
causing trouble for you and then travel to

`Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Forwarding`

\[caption id="attachment\_461" align="aligncenter" width="696"\][![Gmail
forwarding](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-4-13-48-pm.png){.size-full
.wp-image-461 width="696"
height="177"}](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-4-13-48-pm.png)
Gmail forwarding\[/caption\]

This is where we are going to forward all the mail from the school
account to either your main account or a school email or just another
email account of yours in general.

If you lack an account, you can just make a new one and then set the new
one up with Gmail, so that it integrates with
[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com).

Now, here’s how it’ll turn out if you end up doing that:

\[caption id="attachment\_466" align="aligncenter"
width="696"\][![AIrmail
success!](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-8-06-35-pm.png){.size-full
.wp-image-466 width="696"
height="177"}](http://fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-8-06-35-pm.png)
Airmail success!\[/caption\]

As you can see, my testing email worked!

The email sent from my Hampton school email account was forwarded to
another school account, which in turn is already directly set up with my
Airmail.

**All my school emails** have now been integrated and I will no longer
have to constantly sign in to Gmail one account at a time (which is
*SUPER* annoying).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com) allows me easy and might I
add *very* professional looking access to ALL my email accounts, which
are now nicely organized for me to go through.

Success!
