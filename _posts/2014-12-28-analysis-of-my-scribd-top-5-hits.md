1\) So first on my list, with \~2,500 views, we have (surprise,
surprise), a practice sociology test from my class at
[TCC](http://tcc.edu) officially dubbed as `Sociology Test 2 TCC`.

> Comments: I'm glad people are so eager to look at a test that
> literally has no answers provided. 😝

2\) Moving on to \#2, we have `Literary Devices in "1984"` with \~1,200
view. Ah, yes...

> Comments: I'm actually pleasantly surprised that a homework assignment
> back from my 11th grade English class has been read so often and is
> able to help people out. I really enjoyed that book so finding the
> quotes that tie in with certain devices was a no brainer.

3\) Ranked 3rd, with \~1K views we have my Calculus `Section 4.1 HW`. I
never really felt [WebAssign](https://webassign.com) homework
assignments were very engaging so to poke some fun at 'em, I've uploaded
a lot of them to my Scribd.

> Comments: This assignment being ranked 3rd is just strange though,
> given that the majority of the answers were unable to be converted for
> visibility purposes in a PDF file. Ah, well.

4\) Second to last, we have my `AP Statistics Project - Gummy Bears` with
a our goal being to design a controlled experiment to test a factor that
will affect how far gummy bears will “fly” from a catapult. It sounds
fun, but it really wasn't.

> Comments: Joke's on you. I'm pretty sure my team got a terrible grade
> on this project.

\[scribd id=229285162 key=key-Q4lMH5WQaIEsUeVMkkiM mode=scroll\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5\) Friggin' finally we have what I purposely called
`Chapter 4 - Starting Out With Java: Early Objects - HW`. This one has
roughly 500 views.

> Comments: This is easily one of the easiest homework assignments I've
> ever had (see what I did there?).
