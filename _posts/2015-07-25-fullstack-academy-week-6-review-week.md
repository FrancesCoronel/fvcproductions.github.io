Day One - Monday {#dayone-monday}
----------------

-   This is my last week as a junior. I guess I could go all cliche here
    and say that time flew by, but eh, to be honest, I’ve time traveled
    in a pretty normal way, which does surprise me.
-   I didn’t go to school today. I was super sick. :(

![Shaping up with
Angular](https://s3.amazonaws.com/accredible_courses/images/11072/original/shaping-up-with-angular-js-ec0c2defe370994018c29f0b65e56a3b.jpg){.aligncenter}

-   Thankfully, since we covered angular directives and `ng-model`
    today, it wasn’t that bad since I finished that **Shaping up with
    Angular.js** Code School course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Two - Tuesday {#daytwo-tuesday}
-----------------

-   More work on the flashcards application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Three - Wednesday {#daythree-wednesday}
---------------------

-   Today, my partner Yves and I were the only team that showcased a
    flashcard design. So by default, we both won and lost the
    mini-competition for the best flashcard design. We each get a
    Fullstack t-shirt (I still haven’t gotten this yet -\_\_-).
-   Here’s how the home page for our design ended up looking like, more
    or less: ![HomePage](https://i.imgur.com/8Lh7IJw.png){.aligncenter}
-   We used [FlatUI](https://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/), naturally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Four - Thursday {#dayfour-thursday}
-------------------

-   Spelunking.
-   Second day working on authentication.
-   Learning team lunch today. I’m getting better at Avalon. 😈

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Five - Friday {#dayfive-friday}
-----------------

-   More auth stuff.
-   Last day of being a junior!!!
-   My contribution to Fullstack so far has been this [Google Slide
    deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZUYwxJzXCNsvC7x_tiwVRCIGVljh5EFzanV1U9WJl18/edit?usp=sharing)
    showcasing a bunch of web dev stuff I feel is relevant. I should
    probably update it soon. ![Fullstack Web Dev Tips and
    Tricks](https://i.imgur.com/hDbtU5A.png){.aligncenter}
-   We go over what’s going to be in senior phase.
    -   Unfortunately, I think I will only be able to work with other
        college of code students on my final project, since we have 2
        less weeks. I don’t know how I feel about this since I wanted to
        work with Yves, who isn’t in the summer of code program, since
        we have complementary skills (my strong suite is front-end, his
        is back-end). Darn.

Review Week! {#reviewweek}
------------

### A week where we get a break from Fullstack, take some review assessments, and get the opportunity to revitalize for the intense project phase ahead of us. {#aweekwherewegetabreakfromfullstacktakesomereviewassessmentsandgettheopportunitytorevitalizefortheintenseprojectphaseaheadofus.}

> Monday through Wednesday

-   Normally, I publish my posts every Friday, but since review week is
    right after my last junior week, I figured I’d just publish the
    Friday or Saturday of review week instead.
-   I went back home and relaxed for most of this week.
    -   Thankfully, the first three assessments for this week weren’t
        mandatory.

> Thursday

-   I’m the only person from 1506 who went to Game Night today. I played
    this creepy and descriptive house game. It was terribly complicated,
    but it was macabre enough to be somewhat enjoyable. 😈

> Friday

-   I got to 4 kyu on
    [Codewars](https://codewars.com/users/fvcproductions) today.
    FINALLLLLLYYYY.
-   While working late, I come across this show called [**Dating
    Naked**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dating_Naked) and I’m just
    blown away. `#reviewweeksurprise`
-   I’m pretty excited for the project phase. :)

> Saturday

-   This Saturday, I’ll be attending the [Sally
    Conference](https://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/223064683/).
    The tickets are **300 DOLLARS**, but Shanna G., who is part of the
    hiring team here at Fullstack, had some free tickets to give out -
    so to you, Shanna, I say…
