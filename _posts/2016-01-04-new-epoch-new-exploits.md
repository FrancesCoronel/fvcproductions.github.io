    epoch
    noun |ˈepək|
    - a period of time in history or a person's life, typically one marked by notable events or particular characteristics: the Victorian epoch.

    exploit
    noun |ˈekˌsploit|
    - a bold or daring feat: the most heroic and secretive exploits of the war.

In other words, here are my big plans for this year.

1.  Attend more conferences.
2.  Attend more hackathons.
3.  Graduate.

1. Attend more conferences. {#1.attendmoreconferences.}
===========================

It’s always hard trying to find out which conferences I can really
afford to go to time or money-wise, but I realize every time I’ve gone
to one, they’ve been just ridiculously helpful in terms of personal
growth. So, naturally, I need to go to a lot more. I'm going to register
for the big names this year like [Google
I/O](https://events.google.com/io2015/) and [Apple's
WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/).

Also making sure to attend more Meetups would be ideal too. Which brings
me back to the thought that it would be really handy if
[Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) featured how many Meetups you’ve
attended in a similar style to how GitHub tells you how many commits
you’ve done over the past 12 months.

2. Attend more hackathons. {#2.attendmorehackathons.}
==========================

Okay, this is actually super easy. `MLH` has a ridiculously awesome
site, so that I’m attacked by an army of possible hackathons to attend
every time I visit.

Also, the fact that I got accepted to [TreeHacks](http://treehacks.com)
was a big ego booster.

3. Graduate {#3.graduate}
===========

**I MUST MOVE ON!!!**

*To a Master’s?*

Well, that’s the plan anyways. As much as I’d like to just get to work
right after I get my Bachelor’s, it’s not going to kill me to spend one
or two more years trying to **formally** learn some more before I stop
**formally** learning for a while.

Also, there’s that tiny little problem, knowing myself, where I would
never go back to get a Master’s probably if I went straight to work.

Speaking of school, I’m also hoping to get the local college clubs more
involved with hackathons/meetups and the like.

Cause it’s my job and it’s pretty awesome. No, but seriously, it’s my

myself here.
