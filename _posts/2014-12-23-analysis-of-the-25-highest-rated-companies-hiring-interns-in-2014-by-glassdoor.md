So before this becomes outdated, I just wanted to share some thoughts on
what Glassdoor published for this year in terms of the highest rated
companies by interns. I’m in that intern stage myself and I wanted to go
deeper in terms of analysis. 📈

Here’s the original graph that I got from the [original
article](http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/25-highest-rated-companies-hiring-interns-2014-facebook-debuts-1/)
where they published this data.

What I noticed immediately is that the majority of the companies were in
either finance or tech, which makes perfect sense because those are the
hot fields right now. ♨️

📊 Now this is what I came up with using Numbers, this is sorted by
company rating from the interns:

\[scribd id=250881798 key=key-3uyeQYEF8TNpCqF3Uprc mode=scroll\]

I highlighted in **red** the company rating and the interview difficulty
if they were in the top 10. So the top 10 highest rated and hardest
interviews were highlighted in red. 😱

From this I could infer the following: if you were looking for a great
internship experience but didn’t want to the interview to be so bad,
[Qualcomm](http://qualcomm.com),
[Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html),
[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com), [Exxon
Mobil](http://corporate.exxonmobil.com), [Texas
Instruments](http://www.ti.com) and [Johnson and
Johnson](http://www.jnj.com) are the way to go. 😙

However, the companies that have hard interviews but not necessarily the
best intern experience (at least relative to the top guys) were
[P&G](http://www.pg.com/en_US/index.shtml), [Morgan
Stanley](http://www.morganstanley.com), [Goldman
Sachs](http://www.goldmansachs.com), [Amazon](http://amazon.com), and
[Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com). 😗

And those who just ranked in the top 3 for company rating were
[Facebook](http://facebook.com), [Google](http://google.com), and
[Epic](http://epic.com) (surprise, surprise - all software monopolies).
😚

Either way, you should consider yourself lucky if you get an internship
to any of these companies! 😃

I also have them sorted specifically by [interview
difficulty](https://www.scribd.com/doc/250881799/Interns-Glassdoor-Interview-Difficulty),
if you’re interested.
