## About

Stanford's annual hackathon.

## Project

> *Ammalia.* Where surgeons go to explore.

Ammalia, which means surgery in Arabic, is a Leap Motion assisted app that allows a surgeon to analyze pictures of their patient's problem (i.e. brain tumors) using the Dropbox API.

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://devpost.com/software/ammalia">Ammalia</a></h4><p>Ammalia - A Leap Motion assisted app allowing medical professionals to view and manipulate scans while scrubbed in and sterile</p></blockquote>

> We also created a README badge to be used for project READMEs hacked out at the TreeHacks hackathon at Stanford.

### Use Cases

The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in & sterile in the OR.

### Branding

- Theme Color: `#62A7C6` - Font: `Karla`

### Future Features

1. We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time.
2. Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation.
3. Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase different health record data points that pertain to the patient being showcased\ (i.e. name, age, background, etc).

### Tools

- [Leap Motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/)
  - uses Leap Motion API and hardware to track hand gestures (pan in/out, zoom in/out, slide right/left) without physically touching computer
- [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers)
  - uses Dropbox for uploading/storing images for patientâ€™s problems
  - has folders within Dropbox API to represent a single patient

### Team

### Coverage

> This is a Medium article about one of my teammates from the hackathon - Stephanie. She was awesome! ðŸ˜Š

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://medium.com/@hackwithtrees/hacker-spotlight-stephane-zeidan-52a4c90375e8">Hacker Spotlight: Stephanie Zeidan - TreeHacks - Medium</a></h4><p>In these three weeks leading up to TreeHacks, we'll be doing a series of hacker spotlights, or deep dives into the stories of a few members of the ever-growing hackathon community. In their own words and with only slight editing for clarity, hackers will have the chance to explain their backgrounds, tell their stories, and (humble)brag about their coolest hacks What got you into hacking?</p></blockquote>
