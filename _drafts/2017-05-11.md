# Interview with Kapor Capital

> How an MS in CS student with no prior VC experience got an interview with one of the most well-recognized VC firms in Silicon Valley.

First, I would like to say how grateful I am for having been given the opportunity to interview with Kapor Capital as a summer associate. While I did not end up getting an offer, I learned a lot along the time and wanted to share tidbits from my experience.

To provide some context, there were approximately 650 applicants this year which is over a 200% increase from last year when there were only about 200. Of the applicants for this year, there were only four summer associate openings.

In other words, the competition was **tough** but I was one of the lucky few to get invited to interview on-site on May 10th.

While I won't share any details from my interview day, I do want to give some insight into the process and how I prepared as someone who had very little experience in VC.
