After interviewing with a few of the new and upcoming alternative long-term programs for CS education, I think I'm qualified enough to talk about what the key differences are.

Most coding bootcamps are 2 to 4 months (8 to 12 weeks) long.

The alternatives:

- [42](https://www.42.us.org/)
- [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/)
- [Holberton School](http://holbertonschool.com)
- [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com/)
- [Turing School](https://www.turing.io)
- http://www.missionu.com/


|| 42 | Galvanize | Holberton School | Make School | Turing School |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Duration**     | 3-5 years | 6 months |  2 years | 2 years | 7 months |
| **Time** | | M-F 9am-5pm | | |

| **Acceptance Rate** | are neat | $1 |
| **Age Range** | 18-30 | 18+ | 18+ | 13+ | 18+ |

## Holberton School

You can find the syllabus for the 1st year of their program [here](https://holbertonschool.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/syllabus/holberton_school_syllabus_03082017010101.pdf).

## Some common patterns

- Gamification
- thorough admissions process
- All bootcamps will accept someone who is at least 18 years
