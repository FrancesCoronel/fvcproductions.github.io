After interviewing with a few of the new and upcoming alternative long-term programs for CS education, I think I'm qualified enough to talk about what the key differences are.

Most coding bootcamps are 2 to 4 months (8 to 12 weeks) long.

The alternatives:

- [42](https://www.42.us.org/)
- [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/)
- [Holberton School](http://holbertonschool.com)
- [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com/)
- [Turing School](https://www.turing.io)
- http://www.missionu.com/


|| 42 | Galvanize | Holberton School | Make School | Turing School |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Duration**     | 3-5 years | 6 months |  2 years | 2 years | 7 months |
| **Time** | | M-F 9am-5pm | | |
| **Tuition** | Free | $21K  | | | $20K (comes with new laptop), otherwise $18,800
| **Acceptance Rate** | are neat | $1 |
| **Age Range** | 18-30 | 18+ | 18+ | 13+ | 18+ |

## Holberton School

You can find the syllabus for the 1st year of their program [here](https://holbertonschool.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/syllabus/holberton_school_syllabus_03082017010101.pdf).

## Some common patterns

- Gamification
- thorough admissions process
- All bootcamps will accept someone who is at least 18 years

How to prepare for 42?

# To Trust or Not To Trust

**Coding bootcamps** are growing [*more and more popular each year*](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/09/17/as-coding-bootcamps-grow-the-skills-gap-could-shrink) . üìà

Beginning in 2012, coding bootcamps began offering courses in software development and promising graduates new careers in technology. The schools, now backed by hundreds of millions in VC funding, will educate about **30,000 students** in 2016, and rake in just shy of **half a billion** in tuition fees. üí∞

Even the creator of *[‚ÄúCracking the Coding Interview‚Äù](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) *has gone ahead and vouched for the *[value of coding bootcamps herself](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-that-whole-coding-bootcamp-thing-is-a-scam-right-6fddf14087d4#.meynkdi7c). *üìñ

**But a key pain point** for a lot of potential students is whether or not they‚Äôll really be able to get a job right afterward and how **trustworthy** it is.

To combat this, in early 2015, a group of coding schools sent a letter to President Obama, [pledging to release standardized and audited outcome reports](http://thenesta.org/). That never happened. üòû

As of today, [*Flatiron is still one of the very few coding bootcamps*](http://blog.flatironschool.com/announcing-flatiron-schools-2015-jobs-report/) in the world with an independently verified job placement report for all graduates. üíº

This app would make that a reality for all coding bootcamps by automatically parsing information from LinkedIn and Glassdoor in order to **predict job placement salary** based off of **publicly available alumni and job salary data**. üéâ

The app can also validate alumni reviews by **aggregating them** from across the web where they are posted (Yelp, Quora, Course Report, techendo, etc.) and filtering to include only **unique reviews**. üéâüéâ

Ultimately, the goal is to add a layer of trustworthiness to coding bootcamps which as of right now, have *[no standard measurements for job placement rates](http://www.ibtimes.com/code-boot-camps-fail-obama-unaudited-stats-cast-doubt-success-rates-2301188) *with some going as far as *[trying to hide negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2h6abk/are_coding_bootcamp_horror_stories_common/)*.üë∫

The demand for this kind of product is very high and here are two recent articles that speak more on this: *[Could coding boot camps see stricter standards?](http://www.myajc.com/news/technology/could-coding-boot-camps-see-stricter-standards/ns4kQ/) *(Nov 2016) and *[Students are demanding the facts about coding bootcamps](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/students-are-demanding-the-facts-about-coding-bootcamps/)* (Aug 2016). üì∞

Feedback on this idea would be much appreciated. üòä
