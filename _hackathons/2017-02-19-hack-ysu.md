Make something AWESOME in 36 hours at Youngstown State University's third annual regional hackathon! Join us at the beautiful Stambaugh Stadium February 17th-19th for Youngstown Peguin Hackers' third annual HackYSU!

Students will have 36 hours to create anything they want – software, hardware, an app, a game, anything – in the pursuit of knowledge, glory, and prizes. Hacks will be exhibited science fair style in a showcase at the end of the weekend.

All meals will be provided, and mentors from local tech companies will be there to help get you and your team started and get you to the finish line! No experience necessary - only a drive to learn and make something awesome!
