#### [**MBA & MS - Computer Science**](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/business/mba/comp_science.html) {#mbams-computerscience}

-   **About**
    -   This degree is designed to provide MSCS students with a broad
        business education, which will increase their value to the firms
        where they will apply their information technology skills.
    -   The combined degree will position these students to assume
        leadership roles in these firms.
    -   In the combined degree, students will gain not only technical
        knowledge provided in the MSCS program but the ability to put
        that technical knowledge to use in business applications.
    -   Graduates of the combined program will be highly sought after by
        businesses.
    -   The vast majority of the graduates of MSCS already pursue
        careers in business, and with an MBA, they will be even more
        valuable to these businesses.
    -   This combined program has identified courses with subject matter
        that is essential to both degree programs.
    -   As a result, we are giving graduates of this combined degree a
        broader education than students would obtain by taking only one
        of these programs.
-   **Required to Apply**
    -   Students qualifying for the MS Computer Science/MBA joint degree
        will be allowed to enter the program directly following their
        bachelors degree without having previously obtained a masters
        degree.
    -   Under other circumstances, the College of Business usually
        requires students to have an advanced degree or 5 years of
        business experience to enter their 48 credit MBA program.
    -   Admission decisions for the combined degree program will be made
        separately by each program’s admissions committee.
    -   An applicant may originate the application in either department
        or may already be admitted to one or the other program.
    -   The candidate would have to be approved by both admissions
        committees to gain admission to the combined program.

-   **About**
    -   Concurrent degree programs allow students to earn an MBA plus
        another UCLA graduate degree in a combined track, providing the
        opportunity to develop theoretical and practical knowledge in
        another program simultaneously with your MBA studies.
-   **Required to Apply**
    -   Applicants must submit separate application materials to each
        program, following the instructions set forth on each program’s
        website.

        separately by each department, and you must be admitted to both
        programs to be considered a concurrent degree student.
    -   For admission to the MBA program, concurrent degree applicants
        are evaluated as part of the entire MBA applicant pool.
    -   A student already enrolled in one program is not automatically
        guaranteed admission to the other program.
