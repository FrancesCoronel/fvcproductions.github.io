Overall, my experience with Product School was pretty great. I learned a
lot of practical material from my instructor, [Christopher
Andersson](http://linkedin.com/in/christopherandersson).

To be honest, though, I initially thought the content was too mediocre
and was considering dropping the class. Despite this, I was encouraged
that it would be worth it if I stuck with it.

Soon enough, Chris started to open up more and acted more transparent
about what content would be most relevant. I felt I came with a better
idea of what being a product manager is actually like and how to better
leverage my existing skills for that position. The students in my class
were also all very bright and fun to be around.

I think with a little more improvements to the content/slides, Product
School's PM class can be made even greater.
