▸ The School for Field Studies creates transformative study abroad
experiences through field-based learning and research. Students part of
the Wildlife Management program study how changes in land-use and
resource can be managed to foster the well-being of local communities
while safeguarding and promoting biodiversity conservation.

✔︎ learned how to perform the effective identification, sampling, and
data collection and analysis methods for flora and fauna; remote and
on-ground sensing; spatial mapping; survey design and interviewing
skills; and communication skills (report writing and public
presentation)\
✔︎ gained foundational skills in observation and evaluations of
wildlife, as well as interactive methods used for assessing local
community attitudes and behaviors toward conservation efforts and
applied these techniques to advance long-term research goals at the
research center

Received college credit from Boston University for completing this
course.
